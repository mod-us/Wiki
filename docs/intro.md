# Welcome to Sales Wiki

The canonical, open-source glossary for Sales Capacity & Performance metrics, formulas, and best practices.

## What is Sales Wiki?

Sales Wiki is a community-maintained knowledge base designed to standardize terminology and methodology across RevOps, Sales, and Finance teams. Every term includes:

- **Clear Definition**: Precise explanation of what the term means
- **Formula**: Exact calculation method with variants documented
- **Worked Examples**: Real-world scenarios showing the math
- **References**: Links to additional resources and related terms

## Core Principles

1. **Neutral & Open**: No vendor bias, MIT licensed
2. **Source-First**: All changes via GitHub with full transparency
3. **Explicit Formulas**: No ambiguity in calculations
4. **Worked Examples**: Show the work, don't just tell

## Quick Start

## Philosophy

Sales capacity planning uses inconsistent definitions across companies. One company's "headcount" is another's "capacity." One leader's "efficiency ratio" excludes onboarding costs; another's includes them.

This wiki exists to create a common language. When you say "RRE," everyone knows you mean the same thing. When you cite a formula, it's the same formula your finance partner would use.

Open source. Neutral. Explicit.
