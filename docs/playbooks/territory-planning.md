# Territory Planning Basics

## Definition

**Territory Planning** is the strategic process of dividing market coverage areas and assigning sales resources to maximize revenue potential while balancing workload, opportunity, and capacity.

## Why It Matters

- Impacts rep productivity, satisfaction, and retention
- Determines coverage efficiency and market penetration
- Affects quota fairness and attainment distribution
- Critical for scaling sales organizations

## Core Components

### 1. Market Segmentation

Divide the total addressable market by:
- **Geography**: Region, city, zip code
- **Industry**: Vertical, sub-vertical
- **Company Size**: Employee count, revenue band
- **Product Fit**: Use case, tech stack
- **Account Tier**: Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB

### 2. Capacity Assessment

Calculate available selling capacity:
```
Available Capacity = Target RRE × Productive Time %
```

**Example:**
- 25 target RRE
- 70% productive time (30% spent on admin, training, etc.)
- Available capacity: 25 × 0.70 = 17.5 productive RRE

### 3. Coverage Model

Match capacity to opportunity:

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Geographic** | Reps own a region | Field sales, localized buying |
| **Account-Based** | Reps own named accounts | Enterprise, strategic accounts |
| **Industry Vertical** | Reps specialize by industry | Complex, vertical-specific solutions |
| **Hybrid** | Combination of above | Large, diverse orgs |

### 4. Workload Balancing

Ensure territories are equitable:
- **Opportunity Density**: Revenue potential per territory
- **Account Count**: Number of accounts per rep
- **Travel Time**: Geographic dispersion
- **Competitive Landscape**: Win rate variability

## Worked Example

### Scenario: Mid-Market SaaS Company

**Given:**
- Total addressable accounts: 5,000
- Sales team: 20 AEs (18 RRE after ramp adjustment)
- Target: 250 accounts per rep
- Coverage model: Geographic + industry overlay

**Territory Design:**

1. **Segment by Geography**
   - West (2,000 accounts) → 8 reps
   - Central (1,500 accounts) → 6 reps
   - East (1,500 accounts) → 6 reps

2. **Overlay by Industry**
   - Healthcare specialists (3 reps) cover healthcare accounts across all regions
   - Financial services specialists (2 reps) cover finserv accounts
   - Remaining 15 reps cover general B2B

3. **Balance Workload**
   - Target: 250 accounts per rep
   - Adjust for opportunity size (larger opportunities = fewer accounts)

## Best Practices

### Quarterly Review Cadence

1. **Analyze Performance**
   - Which territories over/under-performing?
   - Are account counts balanced?
   - Has market potential shifted?

2. **Identify Changes Needed**
   - Market expansion/contraction
   - Team growth/attrition
   - Product launches
   - Competitive dynamics

3. **Minimize Disruption**
   - Avoid mid-quarter changes
   - Communicate changes early
   - Document territory assignments clearly

### Design Principles

1. **Balance Potential**: Equitable opportunity across territories
2. **Minimize Complexity**: Reps should easily understand their coverage
3. **Enable Specialization**: Allow reps to build expertise
4. **Plan for Growth**: Design can accommodate team expansion
5. **Document Clearly**: Written rules of engagement, overlap policies

## Common Pitfalls

- **Equal ≠ Equitable**: Same account count doesn't mean same opportunity
- **Set-and-Forget**: Territories need regular review and adjustment
- **Ignoring Reps**: Top-down design without field input fails
- **Over-Engineering**: Too many rules creates confusion
- **No Change Management**: Poor communication of territory changes

## Red Flags

Watch for these warning signs:
- Wide variance in attainment across territories (>30 percentage points)
- High attrition in specific territories
- Reps frequently disputing account ownership
- New reps consistently assigned "leftover" accounts
- Territories unchanged for 2+ years

## Metrics to Track

- **Attainment Distribution**: Should cluster around 100%, not bimodal
- **Pipeline per Rep**: Similar pipeline coverage ratios
- **Win Rate by Territory**: Consistent win rates (within reason)
- **Account Penetration**: % of assigned accounts actively worked
