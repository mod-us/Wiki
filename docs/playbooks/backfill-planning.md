# Backfill Planning

## Definition

**Backfill Planning** is the process of replacing departed sales employees to restore lost capacity. It includes determining when to backfill, setting start dates, assigning ramp schedules, and tracking recovery progress.

## When to Backfill vs Not

### ✅ Backfill When:

1. **Permanent Departure (Termination/Resignation)**
   - Capacity loss is permanent
   - Role still needed for coverage
   - Budget allows

2. **High-Performing Role**
   - Losing significant capacity
   - Territory/accounts need coverage
   - Competitive risk if left open

3. **Strategic Territory**
   - Key accounts at risk
   - Market penetration goals
   - Contractual commitments

### ❌ Don't Backfill When:

1. **Leave of Absence (LOA)**
   - Employee is returning
   - Temporary capacity loss
   - Backfill would create overstaffing

2. **Performance Termination (Bottom 10%)**
   - Lost capacity was minimal
   - May redistribute accounts to existing team
   - Consider re-leveling role

3. **Restructuring**
   - Role being eliminated
   - Territory being redistributed
   - Coverage model changing

4. **Over-Capacity**
   - Team is above target
   - Can absorb the loss
   - Budget constraints

## The Backfill Planning Process

### Step 1: Log the Attrition

**What to capture:**
- Employee name, role, territory
- Termination/resignation date
- Annual quota
- Current ramp % (if not fully ramped)
- Reason for departure

**Example:**
```
Name: Tom Johnson
Role: Account Executive - Northeast
Territory: North America East
Termination Date: September 30, 2025
Annual Quota: $1.4M
Ramp Status: 100% (fully ramped)
Reason: Voluntary resignation
```

---

### Step 2: Assess Backfill Need

**Decision criteria:**

| Factor | Consider |
|--------|----------|
| **Coverage Risk** | Are key accounts at risk? |
| **Capacity Gap** | How far below target are we? |
| **Budget** | Do we have approval to hire? |
| **Market Timing** | Can we hire quickly? |
| **Team Load** | Can existing team absorb temporarily? |

**Example Decision:**
```
✓ Tom carried $1.4M quota (above-average contributor)
✓ Northeast territory has $5M pipeline at risk
✓ Already 30% below capacity target
✓ Backfill budget pre-approved
→ DECISION: Backfill immediately
```

---

### Step 3: Set Expected Start Date

**Formula:**
```
Expected Start Date = Termination Date + Time-to-Hire
```

**Time-to-Hire Benchmarks:**

| Role Level | Typical Time-to-Hire |
|------------|---------------------|
| **SDR/BDR** | 4-6 weeks |
| **Mid-Market AE** | 6-8 weeks |
| **Enterprise AE** | 8-12 weeks |
| **Sales Manager** | 10-14 weeks |

**Example:**
```
Termination: September 30
Role: Enterprise AE
Time-to-Hire: 8 weeks
─────────────────────────────
Expected Start Date: November 25 ≈ Month 3
```

**⚠️ Important:** Account for:
- Notice period at current employer (2-4 weeks)
- Background checks (1 week)
- Holidays/vacations
- Onboarding prep time

---

### Step 4: Assign Ramp Schedule

**Standard ramp schedule** (adjust by role complexity):

| Month | Ramp % | Typical Activities |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **Month 1** | 0% | Training, shadowing, learning |
| **Month 2** | 25% | First deals, light quota |
| **Month 3** | 50% | Half quota, building pipeline |
| **Month 4** | 75% | Near-full quota |
| **Month 5+** | 100% | Fully ramped |

**Ramp schedule variations:**

| Role Type | Ramp to 100% |
|-----------|-------------|
| **SDR** | 3 months |
| **SMB AE** | 4 months |
| **Mid-Market AE** | 5 months |
| **Enterprise AE** | 6-9 months |
| **Sales Manager** | 6-12 months |

**Example for Tom's Backfill:**
```
Role: Enterprise AE
Start: November 25
Ramp Schedule:
  Nov (partial): 0%
  Dec: 0%
  Jan: 25%
  Feb: 50%
  Mar: 75%
  Apr+: 100%
```

---

### Step 5: Calculate Capacity Recovery

**Quarterly capacity contribution:**

```
Q Contribution = (Annual Quota / 12) × Σ (Monthly Ramp %)
```

**Example: Tom's Backfill**
```
Annual Quota: $1.4M
Monthly Quota: $1.4M / 12 = $116.7K

Q4 2025 (Nov-Dec):
  Nov: $116.7K × 0% = $0
  Dec: $116.7K × 0% = $0
  Q4 Total: $0

Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar):
  Jan: $116.7K × 25% = $29.2K
  Feb: $116.7K × 50% = $58.3K
  Mar: $116.7K × 75% = $87.5K
  Q1 Total: $175K

Q2 2026 (Apr-Jun):
  Apr-Jun: $116.7K × 100% × 3 = $350K
  Q2 Total: $350K (fully ramped)
```

### Step 6: Track Recovery Progress

**Key metrics to monitor:**

#### 1. Time to Backfill (Actual vs Target)

```
Target: 8 weeks
Actual: 10 weeks
→ 2 weeks behind schedule
```

#### 2. Recovery Lag

```
Tom left: Sept 30
Backfill reaches 100%: April 1
Recovery Lag: 6 months
```

#### 3. Backfill Rate

```
Q4 Departures: 5 people
Q4 Backfills: 1 person started
Backfill Rate: 20% (concerning - need to accelerate hiring)
```

#### 4. Unrecovered Gap

```
Q4 Loss Capacity: $5.0M
Q4 Recovered (partial ramp): $0.9M
Unrecovered Gap: $4.1M
```

## Backfill vs Net-New Hiring

### Backfill Hire
- **Purpose:** Replace lost capacity
- **Timing:** Reactive (after departure)
- **Budget:** Usually pre-approved
- **Urgency:** High (coverage at risk)
- **Success metric:** Recovery lag

### Net-New Hire
- **Purpose:** Add capacity (growth)
- **Timing:** Proactive (expansion)
- **Budget:** Requires new headcount approval
- **Urgency:** Medium (strategic growth)
- **Success metric:** Time to full productivity

## Backfill Planning Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Immediate Backfill (Standard)

```
✓ Termination: Oct 1
✓ Backfill req approved: Oct 1 (same day)
✓ Start recruiting: Oct 1
✓ Offer accepted: Nov 15 (6 weeks)
✓ Start date: Dec 1 (8 weeks total)
✓ Fully ramped: May 1 (6 months from termination)
```

**Recovery Lag: 6 months**

---

### Scenario 2: Delayed Approval

```
❌ Termination: Oct 1
❌ Backfill req approved: Nov 15 (6 weeks delay!)
✓ Start recruiting: Nov 15
✓ Offer accepted: Jan 1 (6 weeks)
✓ Start date: Jan 15 (14 weeks total)
✓ Fully ramped: June 15 (8.5 months from termination)
```

**Recovery Lag: 8.5 months** (40% longer due to approval delay)

---

### Scenario 3: No Backfill

```
❌ Termination: Oct 1
❌ Backfill decision: Do not fill
❌ Capacity recovery: Never
```

**Recovery Lag: ∞ (capacity permanently lost)**

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Pre-Approve Backfill Budget

**Policy example:**
> "All attrition backfills auto-approved up to [headcount target]. No separate req needed."

**Benefit:** Eliminates 2-6 week approval lag

### 2. Maintain Evergreen Pipeline

**Strategy:**
- Always recruiting, even when not actively hiring
- Warm candidate pipeline ready to activate
- Regular sourcing/networking

**Benefit:** Reduces time-to-hire from 8 weeks to 4 weeks

### 3. Warm Territory Handoff

**Process:**
- Departing rep introduces accounts to backfill
- Backfill shadows final 2 weeks (if possible)
- Territory documentation prepared in advance

**Benefit:** Reduces ramp time by 1-2 months

### 4. Standardize Ramp Schedules

**By role:**
- SDR: 3-month ramp
- AE: 5-month ramp
- Enterprise AE: 6-month ramp

**Benefit:** Predictable capacity forecasting

### 5. Track Leading Indicators

**Monitor:**
- Open requisitions (age)
- Candidate pipeline (stage)
- Offer acceptance rate
- Time-to-start after offer

**Benefit:** Early warning of hiring delays

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Waiting for "Perfect" Timing

**Problem:** Delay backfill until "next quarter" or "after planning cycle"

**Impact:** Each month of delay = 1 month longer recovery lag

**Solution:** Auto-approve backfills, hire immediately

### 2. Treating All Backfills Equally

**Problem:** Same urgency/process for losing a top performer vs bottom performer

**Impact:** Mis-prioritize critical backfills

**Solution:** Tier backfills by capacity impact and coverage risk

### 3. Not Accounting for Ramp

**Problem:** "We backfilled Tom, gap is closed"

**Reality:** Backfill at 0% for first month, won't reach Tom's level for 6 months

**Solution:** Track "recovered capacity" not just "backfill count"

### 4. No Territory Coverage Plan

**Problem:** Accounts go dark during vacancy

**Impact:** Lost deals, customer churn, competitive losses

**Solution:** Interim coverage assigned day 1 of vacancy
