# Hiring Planning

## Definition

**Hiring Planning** is the process of determining when and how many sales hires you need to meet capacity targets, accounting for ramp time, attrition, and revenue goals.

## Why It Matters

- **Forward-looking:** Plan hiring 6-12 months ahead to account for ramp
- **Avoid surprises:** Anticipate capacity gaps before they become crises
- **Budget alignment:** Justify headcount requests with capacity math
- **Timeline clarity:** Know exactly when hires need to start work

---

## The Hiring Planning Formula

### Basic Capacity Gap Formula

```
Hiring Need (RRE) = Target Capacity - Current Capacity - Pipeline Capacity + Expected Attrition
```

**Where:**
- **Target Capacity:** Revenue goal / Expected attainment %
- **Current Capacity:** Sum of existing team quotas (ramp-adjusted)
- **Pipeline Capacity:** Hires already in process (with ramp adjustment)
- **Expected Attrition:** Anticipated departures (capacity-weighted)

---

## Worked Example: North America East Q1 2026 Planning

**Context:** End of Q4 2025, planning for Q1 2026

### Step 1: Set Target Capacity

```
Q1 2026 Revenue Goal: $3.0M
Expected Team Attainment: 85%
Target Capacity Needed: $3.0M / 85% = $3.53M
```

---

### Step 2: Calculate Current Capacity

```
End of Q4 2025 Capacity:
  - 10 fully ramped reps × $350K = $3.5M
  - 3 ramping reps × $200K (avg 57%) = $0.6M
  - 1 backfill (Month 2) × $88K (25%) = $0.088M
Total Current: $4.19M
```

---

### Step 3: Adjust for Pipeline

```
Hires Already in Process:
  - 1 offer accepted, starts Jan 15 (Month 1 of Q1)
    Q1 capacity contribution: $350K × 25% (avg Q1 ramp) = $88K

Pipeline Capacity: $0.088M
```

---

### Step 4: Forecast Attrition

```
Historical Q1 Attrition: 3 people (avg capacity: $1.2M)
Q1 2026 Expected Attrition: $1.2M

But: If departures happen mid-quarter, partial capacity remains
Assume 2 months of capacity before departure: $1.2M × (2/3) = $0.8M retained
Net Loss: $1.2M - $0.8M = $0.4M
```

---

### Step 5: Calculate Hiring Need

```
Target Capacity: $3.53M
Current Capacity: $4.19M
Pipeline Capacity: +$0.088M
Expected Net Loss: -$0.4M

Net Capacity at End Q1: $4.19M + $0.088M - $0.4M = $3.88M

Gap to Target: $3.88M - $3.53M = +$0.35M (SURPLUS)

Hiring Need for Q1: 0 additional hires needed
(Already over target, even with expected attrition)
```

---

### Step 6: Look Ahead to Q2 2026

```
Q2 Revenue Goal: $3.5M
Target Capacity: $3.5M / 85% = $4.12M

Starting Q2 Capacity: $3.88M (from Q1 ending)
Gap to Target: $4.12M - $3.88M = $0.24M

If Q2 attrition = $1.2M:
Total Need: $0.24M + $1.2M = $1.44M

Hiring Need: $1.44M / $350K = 4.1 ≈ 5 hires

BUT: Ramp matters!
If hired in Q2, average Q2 capacity contribution = 25% = $88K
5 hires × $88K = $0.44M (not enough to cover $1.44M need)

Need to hire EARLIER (in Q1) to have ramped capacity by Q2
```

---

## Accounting for Ramp Time

### The Ramp-Adjusted Hiring Formula

```
Hires Needed = Capacity Gap / (Quota × Average Ramp % in Period)
```

**Example:**
```
Capacity Gap: $1.5M
Quota per Rep: $350K
Target Period: Q2

If hiring in Q2:
  Average Q2 Ramp: 25% (Month 1-3 average)
  Hires Needed: $1.5M / ($350K × 25%) = 17 hires (unrealistic!)

If hiring in Q1:
  Average Q2 Ramp: 75% (Month 4-6 average)
  Hires Needed: $1.5M / ($350K × 75%) = 5.7 ≈ 6 hires (feasible)
```

**Takeaway:** Hire 1-2 quarters BEFORE you need the capacity

---

## Hiring Timeline Backwards Planning

### Step-by-Step Timeline

**Goal:** 5 fully ramped reps by Q4 2026

**Work backwards:**

| Event | Timeline | Date |
|-------|----------|------|
| **Need full capacity** | Q4 2026 | Oct 1, 2026 |
| **Must start** | 6 months prior | Apr 1, 2026 |
| **Offer accepted** | 2 weeks before start | Mar 15, 2026 |
| **Offer extended** | 1 week before acceptance | Mar 8, 2026 |
| **Final interview** | 2 weeks before offer | Feb 22, 2026 |
| **Phone screen** | 3 weeks before final | Feb 1, 2026 |
| **Job posted** | 4 weeks before screen | Jan 4, 2026 |
| **Req approved** | 2 weeks before posting | Dec 21, 2025 |

**Total lead time:** 9-10 months from approval to full capacity

## Common Hiring Planning Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Hypergrowth (50%+ YoY)

**Challenge:** Need massive hiring ramp

**Example:**
```
Current Capacity: $10M
Target Capacity (next year): $15M
Growth Need: $5M
Attrition (15%): $1.5M
Total Hiring Need: $6.5M / $350K = 18.6 ≈ 19 hires

Hiring by Quarter:
  Q1: 5 hires (to ramp for Q3-Q4)
  Q2: 6 hires (to ramp for Q4 + Q1 next year)
  Q3: 4 hires (to ramp for Q2 next year)
  Q4: 4 hires (to ramp for Q3 next year)
```

**Key:** Front-load hiring to account for ramp lag

---

### Scenario 2: Steady State (10-20% YoY)

**Challenge:** Maintain capacity despite attrition

**Example:**
```
Current Capacity: $10M
Target Capacity (next year): $12M
Growth Need: $2M
Attrition (12%): $1.2M
Total Hiring Need: $3.2M / $350K = 9.1 ≈ 9 hires

Hiring Strategy: 2-3 hires per quarter (evergreen recruiting)
```

---

### Scenario 3: Restructuring (Flat/Negative Growth)

**Challenge:** Optimize team composition

**Example:**
```
Current Capacity: $10M
Target Capacity: $10M (flat)
Attrition: $1.2M
Backfill Need: 3-4 hires

But: Selective backfilling
  - Don't backfill bottom performers (20% of attrition)
  - Upgrade roles (hire Enterprise AE instead of Mid-Market)
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Build 6-Month Rolling Hiring Plans

**Update monthly:**
```
Month 1: Review actual attrition vs forecast
Month 2: Adjust hiring needs based on actuals
Month 3: Update ramp assumptions based on cohort performance
```

---

### 2. Pre-Approve Backfill Budget

**Traditional process:**
```
Employee quits → Wait for approval (2 weeks) → Start recruiting
Time to hire: 8-10 weeks
```

**Pre-approved process:**
```
Employee quits → Start recruiting same day
Time to hire: 6-8 weeks
Saves: 2-4 weeks per hire
```

---

### 3. Maintain Evergreen Pipeline

**Reactive hiring:**
```
Need 5 hires → Post jobs → Source → Screen → Offer
Total: 8 weeks × 5 hires = 40 weeks of effort
```

**Evergreen hiring:**
```
Always recruiting → Warm pipeline ready → Offer within 3 weeks
Total: 3 weeks × 5 hires = 15 weeks of effort
Saves: 25 weeks (62% faster)
```

---

### 4. Segment Hiring by Role

**Not all roles are equal:**

| Role | Ramp Time | Time to Hire | Lead Time Needed |
|------|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| SDR | 3 months | 4-6 weeks | 5 months |
| Mid-Market AE | 4 months | 6-8 weeks | 6 months |
| Enterprise AE | 6 months | 8-12 weeks | 9 months |
| Manager | 6 months | 10-16 weeks | 10 months |

**Plan each role separately**

---

### 5. Account for Seasonal Attrition

**Example attrition patterns:**
```
Q1: 15% of annual attrition (post-holiday departures)
Q2: 25% (spring job market)
Q3: 20% (summer)
Q4: 40% (year-end/vesting)

If annual attrition = 12 people:
  Q1: 2 departures
  Q2: 3 departures
  Q3: 2 departures
  Q4: 5 departures

Plan Q4 backfills to start in Q3 (ramp for Q1 capacity)
```

---

### 6. Use Capacity Waterfalls

**Visualize capacity flows:**

```
Beginning Capacity: $10.0M
  ├─ Attrition: -$1.2M
  ├─ LOA: -$0.3M
  ├─ Existing ramp progression: +$0.5M
  ├─ New hires (Q1 starts): +$0.2M
  └─ Ending Capacity: $9.2M

Gap to Target ($12M): -$2.8M
Hiring Need: 8 more hires (with ramp adjustment)
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Ignoring Ramp Time

**Mistake:**
```
Need $1.5M more capacity in Q2
Hire 4 people in Q2 ($1.4M annual capacity)
Assume: "We're covered!"
```

**Reality:**
```
4 hires in Q2 @ 25% average ramp = $350K Q2 capacity
Still short $1.15M
```

**Fix:** Hire 1-2 quarters ahead

---

### 2. Linear Hiring for Exponential Growth

**Mistake:**
```
Need to grow 50% this year
Hire 50% more people evenly across the year
```

**Reality:**
```
Q1 hires won't ramp until Q3-Q4
Q4 hires won't contribute until next year
Capacity lags growth plan by 6+ months
```

**Fix:** Front-load hiring in H1 for H2 capacity

---

### 3. Not Planning for Attrition

**Mistake:**
```
Current: $10M
Target: $12M
Hire: $2M capacity (6 people)
```

**Reality:**
```
Attrition: $1.2M
Net gain: $2M - $1.2M = $0.8M
Ending capacity: $10.8M (missed target)
```

**Fix:** Hire for growth + attrition replacement

---

### 4. Assuming 100% Offer Acceptance

**Mistake:**
```
Need 5 hires, make 5 offers
```

**Reality:**
```
Offer acceptance rate: 70%
Actual hires: 3.5 (need 2 more offers)
Delays: 4-6 weeks
```

**Fix:** Plan for 70-80% acceptance, have backup candidates
