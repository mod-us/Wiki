# Quota Setting

## Definition

**Quota Setting** is the process of assigning revenue or pipeline targets to individual sales reps and teams based on capacity, territory potential, and company goals.

## Why It Matters

- **Accountability:** Clear performance expectations
- **Motivation:** Achievable but challenging targets
- **Planning:** Capacity-based quotas drive hiring needs
- **Fairness:** Equitable distribution of opportunity
- **Forecasting:** Aggregate quotas = team capacity

---

## Quota Setting Principles

### 1. Top-Down (Company Goal Driven)

```
Company Revenue Goal → Territory Targets → Team Quotas → Individual Quotas
```

**Pros:** Aligned with business objectives
**Cons:** May not reflect market reality

---

### 2. Bottom-Up (Capacity Driven)

```
Individual Capacity → Team Capacity → Territory Capacity → Company Achievable Revenue
```

**Pros:** Realistic, achievable
**Cons:** May undershoot growth ambitions

---

### 3. Hybrid (Best Practice)

```
Top-Down Target: $50M
Bottom-Up Capacity: $45M
Gap: $5M

Resolution:
  - Increase quotas by 10% (stretch)
  - Hire more reps (close gap)
  - Adjust target (realistic revision)
```

---

## Quota Setting Framework

### Step 1: Set Company Revenue Target

**Example: 2026 Planning**

```
2025 Revenue: $40M
2026 Goal: $50M (25% growth)
New ARR Target: $10M
```

---

### Step 2: Allocate to Territories/Segments

**Territory Allocation:**

| Territory | 2025 Actual | 2026 Target | Growth |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **North America East** | $12M | $15M | 25% |
| **North America West** | $10M | $12.5M | 25% |
| **EMEA** | $10M | $13M | 30% |
| **APAC** | $8M | $9.5M | 19% |
| **Total** | $40M | $50M | 25% |

---

### Step 3: Calculate Required Capacity

**Formula:**

```
Required Capacity = Territory Target / Expected Attainment %
```

**Example: North America East**

```
2026 Target: $15M
Expected Attainment: 85%
Required Capacity: $15M / 85% = $17.65M
```

---

### Step 4: Determine Rep Count

**Formula:**

```
Rep Count = Required Capacity / Standard Quota per Rep
```

**Example:**

```
Required Capacity: $17.65M
Standard Enterprise AE Quota: $1.4M

Rep Count: $17.65M / $1.4M = 12.6 ≈ 13 reps
```

---

### Step 5: Set Individual Quotas

**Three approaches:**

#### A. Equal Quotas (Simplest)

```
13 reps × $1.4M = $18.2M capacity
Expected Revenue: $18.2M × 85% = $15.5M (exceeds $15M target)
```

**Pros:** Simple, fair
**Cons:** Ignores territory differences

---

#### B. Differentiated by Territory Quality

**Territory scoring:**

| Rep | Territory | Score | Quota |
|-----|-----------|-------|-------|
| Tom | Enterprise (High) | A | $1.6M |
| Sarah | Enterprise (High) | A | $1.6M |
| Jessica | Enterprise (Medium) | B | $1.4M |
| Kevin | Mid-Market | C | $1.0M |

**Pros:** Fair based on opportunity
**Cons:** Complex to score territories

---

#### C. Differentiated by Experience/Tenure

**Experience-based:**

| Rep | Tenure | Experience | Quota |
|-----|--------|------------|-------|
| Tom | 3 years | Senior | $1.6M |
| Sarah | 2 years | Mid | $1.4M |
| Mark | 6 months | Ramping | $0.7M (50% ramp) |

**Pros:** Accounts for rep capability
**Cons:** May demotivate newer reps

---

## Worked Example: North America East 2026 Quotas

### Context

**Territory:** North America East
**2026 Target:** $15M
**Current Team:** 13 reps
**Role Mix:** 7 Enterprise AEs, 6 Mid-Market AEs

---

### Step 1: Set Standard Quotas by Role

```
Enterprise AE Standard Quota: $1.4M
Mid-Market AE Standard Quota: $1.0M
```

---

### Step 2: Calculate Initial Capacity

```
Enterprise: 7 reps × $1.4M = $9.8M
Mid-Market: 6 reps × $1.0M = $6.0M
Total Capacity: $15.8M

Expected Revenue (85% attainment): $15.8M × 85% = $13.4M
```

**Gap:** $15M target - $13.4M expected = $1.6M short

---

### Step 3: Close the Gap

**Option A: Hire More Reps**

```
Need: $1.6M / 85% = $1.88M more capacity
Hires: $1.88M / $1.4M = 1.3 ≈ 2 more Enterprise AEs

New Capacity: $15.8M + $2.8M = $18.6M
Expected Revenue: $18.6M × 85% = $15.8M ✅ (exceeds target)
```

---

**Option B: Increase Quotas (Stretch)**

```
Increase by 10%:
  Enterprise: $1.4M × 1.1 = $1.54M
  Mid-Market: $1.0M × 1.1 = $1.1M

New Capacity:
  Enterprise: 7 × $1.54M = $10.78M
  Mid-Market: 6 × $1.1M = $6.6M
  Total: $17.38M

Expected Revenue: $17.38M × 85% = $14.8M (close, but still $200K short)
```

---

**Option C: Hybrid (Hire + Stretch)**

```
Hire 1 more Enterprise AE: +$1.4M capacity
Increase quotas by 5%:
  Enterprise: $1.4M × 1.05 = $1.47M
  Mid-Market: $1.0M × 1.05 = $1.05M

New Capacity:
  Enterprise: 8 × $1.47M = $11.76M
  Mid-Market: 6 × $1.05M = $6.3M
  Total: $18.06M

Expected Revenue: $18.06M × 85% = $15.4M ✅ (meets target)
```

**Decision:** Option C (Hire 1 + 5% stretch)

---

### Step 4: Assign Individual Quotas

**Final 2026 Quotas:**

| Name | Role | Tenure | 2025 Attainment | 2026 Quota |
|------|------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Tom | Enterprise AE | 3 yrs | 110% | $1.47M |
| Sarah | Enterprise AE | 2 yrs | 95% | $1.47M |
| Jessica | Enterprise AE | 18 mo | 105% | $1.47M |
| Mark | Enterprise AE | 1 yr | 85% | $1.47M |
| Rachel | Enterprise AE | 2 yrs | 100% | $1.47M |
| David | Enterprise AE | 3 yrs | 120% | $1.47M |
| Chris | Enterprise AE | 2 yrs | 90% | $1.47M |
| **New Hire** | Enterprise AE | New | - | $1.47M |
| Kevin | Mid-Market AE | 2 yrs | 95% | $1.05M |
| Lisa | Mid-Market AE | 1 yr | 75% | $1.05M |
| Amanda | Mid-Market AE | 18 mo | 100% | $1.05M |
| Mike | Mid-Market AE | 2 yrs | 110% | $1.05M |
| John | Mid-Market AE | 1 yr | 85% | $1.05M |
| Emma | Mid-Market AE | 3 yrs | 105% | $1.05M |

**Total Capacity:** $18.06M
**Expected Revenue:** $15.4M (85% attainment)

---

## Quota Attainment Targets

### Healthy Distribution

**Target curve:**

| Attainment | % of Team | Interpretation |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| **< 50%** | 5-10% | Bottom performers (PIP or exit) |
| **50-80%** | 15-20% | Below expectations (coaching) |
| **80-100%** | 30-40% | On track (core performers) |
| **100-120%** | 20-30% | Exceeding (reward) |
| **120%+** | 10-15% | Top performers (promote) |

**Average team attainment: 85-95% is healthy**

---

### Red Flags

**🔴 Too many missing quota (< 70% avg attainment):**
```
Problem: Quotas too high, or poor enablement
Fix: Lower quotas or improve training
```

**🔴 Too many hitting quota (> 110% avg attainment):**
```
Problem: Quotas too low, leaving money on table
Fix: Raise quotas next period
```

**🔴 Bimodal distribution:**
```
Problem: 50% at < 50% attainment, 50% at > 120%
Root cause: Territory imbalance or poor hiring
Fix: Rebalance territories, improve hiring
```

---

## Quota Adjustments Mid-Year

### When to Adjust

**✅ Adjust when:**
- Territory changes (account reassignment)
- Role changes (promotion to manager)
- Extended LOA (> 4 weeks)
- Market shifts (major customer loss)

**❌ Don't adjust for:**
- Individual performance (quota is the target, not moving target)
- "Fairness" requests (maintain consistency)
- Short-term fluctuations

---

### How to Adjust

**Example: Rep promoted to Manager mid-year**

```
Rep: Tom
Current Quota: $1.4M annual ($350K/quarter)
Promotion: July 1 (start of Q3)

Options:

Option A: Prorate Individual + Add Team Quota
  Q1-Q2: $350K × 2 = $700K (individual IC quota)
  Q3-Q4: Team quota $5M (as manager)
  Annual: $700K individual + $5M team

Option B: Full Year Manager Quota
  Annual: $5M team quota (Q3-Q4 prorated at 50%)
  Q1-Q2: Retroactively count toward team quota

Option C: Hybrid (Best Practice)
  Q1-Q2: $700K individual (completed as IC)
  Q3-Q4: $2.5M team quota (50% of annual team quota)
  Annual: $700K + $2.5M = $3.2M blended
```

---

## Ramp Quotas for New Hires

### Standard Ramp Schedule

**6-Month Ramp (Most Common):**

| Month | Ramp % | Monthly Quota | Calculation |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | 0% | $0 | $117K × 0% |
| 2 | 25% | $29K | $117K × 25% |
| 3 | 50% | $58K | $117K × 50% |
| 4 | 75% | $88K | $117K × 75% |
| 5 | 90% | $105K | $117K × 90% |
| 6 | 100% | $117K | $117K × 100% |

**Assumes:** $1.4M annual quota / 12 months = $117K monthly

---

### Quarterly Ramp Quotas

**New hire starts Month 1 of Q1:**

| Quarter | Ramp % | Quarterly Quota |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Q1 (Mo 1-3) | 25% avg | $88K |
| Q2 (Mo 4-6) | 92% avg | $322K |
| Q3 (Mo 7-9) | 100% | $350K |
| Q4 (Mo 10-12) | 100% | $350K |

**Annual ramped quota: $1.11M (vs $1.4M full)**

---

## Quota Setting by Role

### Enterprise AE

**Typical Annual Quota:** $1.4M - $2.0M

**Factors:**
- Deal size: $50K - $200K
- Sales cycle: 6-12 months
- Win rate: 15-25%
- Required pipeline: 3-4x quota

**Benchmark:** $1.4M for mid-sized SaaS

---

### Mid-Market AE

**Typical Annual Quota:** $800K - $1.2M

**Factors:**
- Deal size: $20K - $80K
- Sales cycle: 3-6 months
- Win rate: 25-35%
- Required pipeline: 3x quota

**Benchmark:** $1.0M for mid-sized SaaS

---

### SMB AE

**Typical Annual Quota:** $500K - $800K

**Factors:**
- Deal size: $5K - $30K
- Sales cycle: 1-3 months
- Win rate: 30-40%
- Velocity-focused

**Benchmark:** $600K for mid-sized SaaS

---

### SDR (Pipeline Quota)

**Typical Annual Quota:** $400K - $800K pipeline generated

**Or:** 50-100 qualified meetings/year

**Conversion:**
```
If AE close rate = 25%
SDR pipeline quota = AE quota / 25% = $400K pipeline per $100K ARR
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Set Quotas Annually, Adjust Rarely

**Annual planning cycle:**
```
Q4 prior year: Set quotas for next year
Q1: Lock quotas, no changes
Q2-Q4: Minimal adjustments (only for major changes)
```

**Why:** Consistency, fairness, motivation

---

### 2. Tie Quotas to Compensation

**OTE Structure:**
```
Base Salary: 50-60% of OTE
Variable (Commission): 40-50% of OTE

Commission: Tied to quota attainment
  - 50% quota: 50% variable paid
  - 100% quota: 100% variable paid
  - 120% quota: 120%+ variable (accelerators)
```

---

### 3. Use Accelerators for Over-Performance

**Accelerator example:**
```
0-100% quota: 1.0x commission rate
100-120% quota: 1.25x commission rate
120%+ quota: 1.5x commission rate

Rep hits 130% of $1.4M quota = $1.82M
Commission payout:
  - $1.4M @ 1.0x
  - $280K @ 1.25x (100-120%)
  - $140K @ 1.5x (120-130%)
= Higher than linear to reward top performers
```

---

### 4. Benchmark Against Market

**Use data sources:**
- Comp surveys (Radford, Pave, Option Impact)
- Peer companies
- Industry reports (SaaS Capital, OpenView)

**Example benchmark:**
```
Your Enterprise AE quota: $1.4M
Market median: $1.5M
Your quota is: 93% of market (slightly lower, easier to attain)
```

---

### 5. Review Quarterly

**Quarterly quota review:**
```
Q1: Assess Q1 attainment distribution
  - Too many missing? Quotas too high
  - Too many hitting? Quotas too low

Q2: Minor adjustments if needed

Q3: Preview next year quotas

Q4: Finalize next year quotas
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Sandbagging (Quotas Too Low)

**Mistake:**
```
Set quotas low to ensure everyone hits
Result: 100% of team at 120%+ attainment
Problem: Left revenue on the table
```

**Fix:**
```
Target: 85-95% average attainment
Top 20% at 120%+
Bottom 20% at < 70%
```

---

### 2. Heroic Quotas (Too High)

**Mistake:**
```
Set quotas based on aspirational goals
Result: 10% of team hits quota, mass demotivation
```

**Fix:**
```
Hybrid approach: realistic quotas + stretch goals
Or: Hire more reps to close gap
```

---

### 3. Ignoring Ramp

**Mistake:**
```
New hire Month 1: Assign full $1.4M quota
Result: Rep misses badly, feels set up to fail
```

**Fix:**
```
Ramp quotas: Month 1 = 0%, Month 6 = 100%
Fair expectations
```

---

### 4. Unfair Territory Distribution

**Mistake:**
```
Rep A: Tier 1 accounts, high intent
Rep B: Tier 3 accounts, low intent
Both have same $1.4M quota

Result: Rep A hits 150%, Rep B hits 60%
Rep B feels unfair
```

**Fix:**
```
Adjust quotas by territory quality:
  Rep A (Tier 1): $1.6M quota
  Rep B (Tier 3): $1.2M quota

Or: Rebalance territories
```

---

### 5. No Capacity Math

**Mistake:**
```
"Let's give everyone $1.5M quotas!"
No check on: Do we have enough reps? Is it achievable?
```

**Fix:**
```
Capacity math:
  Team capacity = Σ (individual quotas)
  Expected revenue = Capacity × attainment %
  Does this meet company goal?
```
