# Attrition Management

## Definition

**Attrition Management** is the systematic process of tracking, analyzing, and responding to employee departures to minimize capacity loss and maintain organizational health.

## Why It Matters

- **Capacity preservation:** Every departure = lost capacity
- **Early warning system:** Spot trends before they become crises
- **Retention strategies:** Identify root causes and intervene
- **Planning accuracy:** Better attrition forecasts = better hiring plans
- **Team morale:** Proactive management prevents team instability

---

## The Attrition Management Framework

### 1. Track

**What to measure:**
- Headcount attrition rate (% of people)
- Capacity attrition rate (% of capacity lost)
- Voluntary vs involuntary
- By segment (role, manager, tenure, performance)

---

### 2. Analyze

**Why are people leaving?**
- Exit interviews
- Cohort analysis (when do people leave?)
- Performance correlation
- Manager correlation

---

### 3. Predict

**Who might leave next?**
- Engagement survey scores
- Performance trends
- Tenure patterns
- Market indicators

---

### 4. Intervene

**What can you do?**
- Retention conversations
- Compensation adjustments
- Career development
- Manager coaching

---

### 5. Plan

**How do we recover?**
- Backfill decisions
- Hiring acceleration
- Team restructuring

## Worked Example: North America East Q4 2025

### Step 1: Track Departures

**Q4 2025 Attrition:**

| Name | Departure Date | Role | Annual Quota | Reason | Type |
|------|----------------|------|--------------|--------|------|
| Tom | Sept 30 | Enterprise AE | $1.4M | Voluntary | Resignation |
| Sarah | Oct 15 | Enterprise AE | $1.4M | Voluntary | Resignation |
| Jessica | Nov 1 | Enterprise AE | $1.4M | Voluntary | Resignation |
| Kevin | Nov 20 | Mid-Market AE | $1.0M | Voluntary | Resignation |
| Lisa | Dec 10 | Mid-Market AE | $800K | Performance | Termination |

**Summary:**
```
Total Departures: 5 people
Total Capacity Lost: $6.0M annual ($5.0M quarterly)
Voluntary: 4 people ($5.2M)
Involuntary: 1 person ($800K)
Headcount Attrition Rate: 5 / 11 = 45.5%
Capacity Attrition Rate: $5.0M / $11M = 45.5%
```

---

### Step 2: Analyze Patterns

**By Role:**
```
Enterprise AE: 3 departures (43% of Enterprise team)
Mid-Market AE: 2 departures (33% of Mid-Market team)

Insight: Enterprise AE role has unusually high attrition
```

**By Timing:**
```
September: 1 departure
October: 1 departure
November: 2 departures
December: 1 departure

Insight: Clustering in Nov-Dec (year-end bonus/vesting period)
```

**By Reason (Voluntary):**
```
Exit Interview Themes:
- 3/4 cited "lack of growth opportunities"
- 2/4 cited "compensation not competitive"
- 2/4 cited "manager relationship"
- 3/4 had tenure < 2 years

Insight: Retention problem with high performers in first 2 years
```

---

### Step 3: Predict Future Attrition

**Historical Pattern:**
```
Q1 2025: 2 departures ($2.0M)
Q2 2025: 2 departures ($2.3M)
Q3 2025: 2 departures ($2.5M)
Q4 2025: 5 departures ($5.0M)

Trailing 4Q Average: 2.75 departures/quarter
Trailing 4Q Capacity Loss: $2.95M/quarter
```

**Q1 2026 Forecast:**
```
Expected Departures: 3 people
Expected Capacity Loss: $1.2M

Reasoning:
- Q4 spike likely due to year-end (one-time)
- Return to baseline ~3 departures/quarter
- Unless interventions made
```

---

### Step 4: Identify At-Risk Employees

**Risk Indicators:**

| Name | Role | Tenure | Last Attainment | Engagement Score | Risk Level |
|------|------|--------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| Mark | Enterprise AE | 18 months | 110% | 6/10 | 🔴 High |
| Rachel | Enterprise AE | 14 months | 95% | 7/10 | 🟠 Medium |
| David | Mid-Market AE | 22 months | 120% | 8/10 | 🟢 Low |

**At-Risk Criteria:**
- Tenure: 12-24 months (flight risk window)
- Engagement: < 7/10
- Performance: Top 30% (most likely to get external offers)

**Q1 2026 At-Risk Capacity: $2.8M (2 people)**

---

### Step 5: Intervene

**Retention Strategy for At-Risk Reps:**

#### Mark (High Risk)

**Intervention Plan:**
```
1. Immediate manager 1:1
   - Career development discussion
   - Promotion timeline clarity
   - Territory/account upgrades

2. Compensation review
   - Benchmark against market
   - Consider off-cycle raise
   - Equity refresh

3. Executive sponsorship
   - Pair with VP for mentorship
   - Include in strategic projects

Timeline: Within 2 weeks
```

#### Rachel (Medium Risk)

**Intervention Plan:**
```
1. Career pathing conversation
   - Clear path to Senior AE or Manager role
   - Skills development plan

2. Recognition
   - Highlight wins in team meetings
   - Include in President's Club planning

Timeline: Within 4 weeks
```

---

### Step 6: Backfill Decision

**For each departure, decide:**

| Departure | Backfill? | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Tom | ✅ Yes | Voluntary, top performer, critical capacity |
| Sarah | ✅ Yes | Voluntary, top performer, critical capacity |
| Jessica | ✅ Yes | Voluntary, top performer, critical capacity |
| Kevin | ✅ Yes | Voluntary, solid performer |
| Lisa | ❌ No | Performance termination, below expectations |

**Backfill Plan:**
```
Approve: 4 backfills ($5.2M capacity)
Start recruiting: Immediately (pre-approved)
Target start dates: Nov-Dec 2025 (for Q1 2026 ramp)
```

---

## Attrition Benchmarks

### By Industry (Sales Roles)

| Segment | Healthy | Concerning | Crisis |
|---------|---------|------------|--------|
| **SaaS Sales** | < 15% annual | 15-25% | > 25% |
| **Tech Sales** | < 20% annual | 20-30% | > 30% |
| **Enterprise AE** | < 15% annual | 15-20% | > 20% |
| **SMB AE** | < 20% annual | 20-30% | > 30% |
| **SDR** | < 30% annual | 30-40% | > 40% |

**North America East Q4 2025: 45.5% quarterly = 181% annualized (CRISIS)**

---

### By Tenure Cohort

**Typical attrition curves:**

```
Month 0-6: 20% (early churn, bad fit)
Month 7-12: 10% (ramp struggles)
Month 13-24: 15% (growth plateau, external offers)
Month 25-36: 5% (tenured, stable)
Month 37+: 10% (burnout, career change)
```

**Flight risk window: 12-24 months (highest voluntary attrition)**

---

## Attrition Cost Analysis

### Full Cost of Attrition

**Direct Costs:**
```
Lost Capacity (Opportunity Cost):
  - Tom's departure (3 months vacant): $350K

Recruiting Costs:
  - Recruiter time: $5K
  - Agency fees (if used): $28K (20% of salary)
  - Interview time: $2K

Onboarding Costs:
  - Training: $10K
  - Manager time: $5K
  - Ramp support: $15K

Total Direct Cost: ~$415K per Enterprise AE departure
```

**Indirect Costs:**
```
Team Morale Impact:
  - Remaining team stress/overwork
  - Pipeline reassignment friction

Customer Impact:
  - Account transitions
  - Relationship disruption

Total Estimated Cost: $500K+ per departure
```

---

## Retention Strategies

### 1. Proactive Career Pathing

**Before:**
```
Rep: "What's my path to promotion?"
Manager: "Keep doing great work, we'll see"

Result: Rep leaves for competitor offering Manager title
```

**After:**
```
Rep: "What's my path to promotion?"
Manager: "Here's the specific criteria for Senior AE and Manager roles.
         Let's build a 12-month development plan."

Result: Rep stays, gets promoted in 14 months
```

---

### 2. Competitive Compensation Reviews

**Annual benchmarking:**
```
Compare:
  - Base salary vs market (by role, geography, experience)
  - OTE vs market
  - Equity vs market

Action:
  - Address 10%+ gaps immediately
  - Refresh equity for high performers every 2 years
```

---

### 3. Manager Development

**Finding:**
```
Attrition by Manager:
  Manager A: 5% annual attrition
  Manager B: 30% annual attrition

Root cause: Manager skills, not comp/role
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Manager training (1:1s, feedback, coaching)
2. 360 reviews
3. Manager scorecards (attrition as KPI)
4. Replace poor managers if no improvement
```

---

### 4. Predictive Interventions

**Use data to act early:**

```
If Engagement Score < 7 AND Tenure = 12-24 months:
  → Schedule retention conversation within 2 weeks

If Attainment > 100% for 3+ quarters AND no promotion:
  → Career development plan + promotion timeline

If Manager has 2+ departures in 6 months:
  → Leadership coaching + team health assessment
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Treating All Attrition as Equal

**Mistake:**
```
"We lost 5 people, that's bad"
```

**Reality:**
```
Lost 5 people:
  - 3 top performers (voluntary) = CRISIS
  - 2 bottom performers (involuntary) = HEALTHY
```

**Fix:** Segment by performance and reason

---

### 2. Only Looking at Headcount Attrition

**Mistake:**
```
10 people left out of 100 = 10% attrition (seems fine)
```

**Reality:**
```
$5M capacity lost out of $20M = 25% capacity attrition (CRISIS)
(Lost the highest performers)
```

**Fix:** Always measure capacity attrition

---

### 3. Reactive Only

**Mistake:**
```
Employee quits → Exit interview → "We should have done more"
```

**Fix:**
```
Monthly at-risk reviews → Proactive interventions → Retention
```

---

### 4. Ignoring Leading Indicators

**Mistake:**
```
Wait until resignation to act
```

**Leading indicators to monitor:**
- Engagement survey drops
- Decreased activity/productivity
- Fewer 1:1s requested
- Increased LinkedIn activity
- Resume updates (if visible)

**Fix:** Weekly at-risk monitoring

---

### 5. No Backfill Pre-Approval

**Mistake:**
```
Employee quits → Wait for approval (2-4 weeks) → Start recruiting
Result: 10+ week time to backfill
```

**Fix:**
```
Pre-approve backfill budget → Employee quits → Start recruiting same day
Result: 6-8 week time to backfill
```

---
