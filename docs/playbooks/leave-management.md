# Leave Management

## Definition

**Leave Management** is the process of tracking, planning for, and responding to employee absences (Leave of Absence, parental leave, medical leave, sabbaticals) to maintain capacity and support team members.

## Why It Matters

- **Temporary vs Permanent:** LOA requires different planning than attrition
- **Legal compliance:** FMLA, parental leave, disability accommodations
- **Team support:** Coverage planning while respecting employee privacy
- **Capacity accuracy:** Distinguish temporary capacity loss from permanent
- **Return planning:** Smooth re-onboarding after extended absence

---

## Types of Leave

### 1. Parental Leave (Most Common)

**Typical Duration:**
- US: 8-16 weeks
- Canada: 12-18 months
- Europe: 6-12 months

**Capacity Impact:**
- Temporary loss during leave
- Ramp-back period after return (often 1-2 months)

---

### 2. Medical Leave (FMLA/STD/LTD)

**Duration:**
- Short-term disability: 6 weeks - 6 months
- Long-term disability: 6+ months (may convert to termination)

**Capacity Impact:**
- Uncertain return date
- May require backfill if extended

---

### 3. Sabbatical

**Duration:**
- Typically 1-3 months
- Usually after 5-7 years tenure

**Capacity Impact:**
- Planned in advance
- Temporary coverage needed

---

### 4. Unpaid Leave

**Duration:**
- Variable (personal reasons)
- Often 1-12 weeks

**Capacity Impact:**
- No compensation during leave
- Role held open (usually)

---

## Leave Management Framework

### 1. Plan Ahead

**When notified of leave:**
```
Employee announces: 12 weeks maternity leave starting March 1

Immediate actions:
  1. Calculate capacity impact
  2. Determine coverage strategy
  3. Pipeline transition plan
  4. Team communication
  5. Return plan
```

---

### 2. Calculate Capacity Impact

**Formula:**
```
Capacity Loss (Leave Period) = Employee Quota × (Leave Duration / Quarter Length)
```

**Example:**
```
Rep: Sarah
Annual Quota: $1.4M
Quarterly Quota: $350K
Leave: 12 weeks (3 months)
Leave Period: Q1 (full quarter)

Q1 Capacity Loss: $350K × (12 weeks / 12 weeks) = $350K
```

---

### 3. Choose Coverage Strategy

**Four options:**

#### Option A: Redistribute Pipeline

**When to use:** Short leave (< 8 weeks), small pipeline, strong team

**Process:**
```
Sarah's Pipeline: $800K (8 active deals)
Coverage:
  - Manager takes 2 largest deals ($400K)
  - Team members take 6 deals ($400K)

No backfill needed
```

**Pros:**
- No hiring costs
- Team development opportunity

**Cons:**
- Overloads remaining team
- May lose some deals in transition

---

#### Option B: Hire Temporary Coverage

**When to use:** Long leave (12+ weeks), large pipeline, specific expertise needed

**Process:**
```
Hire: Contract AE for 3 months
Compensation: 50% of Sarah's base + commission
Cost: $50K for 3 months

Coverage:
  - Handles Sarah's top 10 accounts
  - New leads go to team
```

**Pros:**
- Dedicated coverage
- Protects pipeline

**Cons:**
- Hiring/onboarding time
- May not perform at Sarah's level

---

#### Option C: Promote from SDR Team

**When to use:** Long leave, opportunity to develop SDR into AE

**Process:**
```
Promote: Top SDR to temp AE role
Duration: Sarah's leave period (test run)
  - If successful during leave → permanent AE promotion
  - If struggles → return to SDR role after Sarah returns

Coverage:
  - SDR gets Sarah's territory temporarily
  - Learns AE role with safety net
```

**Pros:**
- Retention tool for top SDR
- Internal development
- May find permanent AE

**Cons:**
- SDR productivity lost
- May not be ready

---

#### Option D: Accept Capacity Gap

**When to use:** Short leave (< 6 weeks), team at/above target

**Process:**
```
Current Capacity: $4.5M
Target Capacity: $4.0M
Sarah's Leave Impact: -$350K
Remaining Capacity: $4.15M (still above target)

Decision: No coverage needed, absorb the gap
```

**Pros:**
- Zero hiring/redistribution effort
- Team not overloaded

**Cons:**
- Only works if already over capacity

---

## Worked Example: Sarah's Parental Leave

### Context

**Employee:** Sarah, Enterprise AE
**Annual Quota:** $1.4M
**Leave:** 12 weeks maternity leave (Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026)
**Team Capacity:** $4.5M (including Sarah)
**Target Capacity:** $4.0M

---

### Step 1: Calculate Impact

```
Q1 Capacity Loss: $350K (Sarah's full Q1 quota)

Remaining Q1 Capacity: $4.5M - $350K = $4.15M
Gap to Target: $4.15M - $4.0M = +$150K (still above target)
```

---

### Step 2: Choose Coverage Strategy

**Decision:** Option A (Redistribute) + Option D (Accept small gap)

**Rationale:**
- Team already above target capacity even without Sarah
- Sarah's pipeline is manageable ($600K)
- Leave is temporary (returning Q2)
- No need for temp hire

---

### Step 3: Pipeline Transition

**Sarah's Pipeline (as of Dec 15):**

| Deal | Value | Stage | Close Date | Assigned To |
|------|-------|-------|------------|-------------|
| Acme Corp | $150K | Negotiation | Jan 15 | → Manager (Michael) |
| Beta Inc | $100K | Demo | Feb 1 | → Manager (Michael) |
| Gamma LLC | $80K | Discovery | Feb 15 | → Peer AE (Mark) |
| Delta Co | $70K | Proposal | Jan 31 | → Peer AE (Rachel) |
| Others (4) | $200K | Early stage | Mar+ | → Team (split) |

**Total Redistributed:** $600K pipeline

---

### Step 4: Team Communication

**Announcement (with Sarah's permission):**
```
Subject: Sarah's Parental Leave & Coverage Plan

Team,

Sarah will be on parental leave Jan 1 - Mar 31. During her leave:

Coverage:
  - Michael: Acme, Beta deals
  - Mark: Gamma deal
  - Rachel: Delta deal
  - Team: Early-stage pipeline split

Sarah's return: April 1, 2026

Please join me in congratulating Sarah!
```

**Privacy Note:** Only share what Sarah approves

---

### Step 5: Return Planning

**Month before return (March 1):**

```
1. Sarah check-in call
   - Confirm return date
   - Discuss transition preferences
   - Pipeline review

2. Ramp-back plan
   - Week 1-2: Part-time (50%) if needed
   - Week 3-4: Full-time
   - Month 2: Full capacity

3. Pipeline restoration
   - Return major accounts
   - Assign new leads
   - Transition coverage deals
```

**Q2 Capacity:**
```
April (Month 1 back): $1.4M × 75% (ramp-back) = $1.05M / 12 × 1 month = $88K
May-June: Full capacity = $1.4M / 12 × 2 = $233K

Q2 Total Contribution: $321K (vs $350K full quarter = 92% capacity)
```

---

## Leave vs Attrition in Capacity Planning

### Critical Distinction

```
Attrition (Permanent):
  - Lost capacity doesn't return
  - Requires backfill
  - Ramp time for replacement

Leave of Absence (Temporary):
  - Capacity returns after leave
  - Backfill optional
  - Minimal ramp after return
```

---

### Accounting for LOA in Capacity

**Mistake:**
```
BOQ Capacity: $11M
Departures: 5 people
LOA: 1 person (Sarah, 12 weeks)
Total "Loss": 6 people = $6.8M

Capacity Planning: "We need to hire 6 backfills"
```

**Correct:**
```
BOQ Capacity: $11M
Permanent Loss: 5 people = $5.0M (backfill needed)
Temporary Loss: 1 person = $1.8M annual, $350K Q1 (coverage, not backfill)

Backfill Need: 5 people (not 6)
Coverage Need: Pipeline redistribution
```

---

### Capacity Waterfall with LOA

**Q4 2025 → Q1 2026:**

```
Beginning of Quarter (BOQ) Capacity: $11.0M
  ├─ Attrition: -$5.0M (permanent, need backfill)
  ├─ LOA: -$0.35M (temporary, return Q2)
  ├─ Ramp progression: +$0.6M (existing hires advancing)
  ├─ New hires: +$0.2M (started in Q4)
  └─ End of Quarter (EOQ) Capacity: $6.45M

Gap to Target ($10M): -$3.55M

Planning:
  - Backfill attrition: 5 hires (for permanent loss)
  - Don't backfill LOA (Sarah returns Q2)
  - Hire for growth: Additional hires as needed
```

---

## LOA Benchmarks

### Average LOA Rates by Region

| Region | Parental Leave Rate | Avg Duration |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| **US** | 8-10% of workforce/year | 12 weeks |
| **Canada** | 8-10% | 12-18 months |
| **Europe** | 8-10% | 26-52 weeks |

**Planning assumption:** 10% of team on leave at any given time

---

### Budget Impact

**Annual LOA costs (non-capacity):**

```
Team Size: 50 reps
LOA Rate: 10% = 5 people on leave during the year
Avg Leave: 12 weeks

Options:
  Option A (Redistribute): $0 direct cost
    - Indirect: Team overload, potential lost deals

  Option B (Temp hire): ~$50K per leave × 5 = $250K
    - Protects pipeline

  Option C (Promote SDR): ~$30K delta × 5 = $150K
    - Plus development benefits
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Plan Early

**As soon as leave is announced:**
```
Sarah announces: December 1 (3 months before leave)

Immediate planning:
  Week 1: Coverage decision
  Week 2: Pipeline review & transition plan
  Week 4: Team communication
  Week 8: Begin transition (shadow/handoff)
  Week 12: Leave begins (seamless)
```

**Last-minute leave:**
```
Announced: 2 weeks before leave (emergency medical)

Rapid planning:
  Day 1: Manager assess pipeline
  Day 2: Redistribution plan
  Day 3: Team communication
  Week 1-2: Transition calls with customers
```

---

### 2. Document Everything

**Leave tracker:**

| Name | Leave Type | Start Date | End Date | Duration | Quota | Coverage Plan |
|------|------------|------------|----------|----------|-------|---------------|
| Sarah | Parental | Jan 1 | Mar 31 | 12 weeks | $350K/Q | Redistribute |
| Mark | Medical | Feb 15 | Apr 15 | 8 weeks | $250K/Q | Temp hire |

**Why:** Accurate capacity reporting, planning, legal compliance

---

### 3. Respect Privacy

**What to share:**
```
✅ "Sarah will be on leave Jan-Mar"
✅ "Coverage plan: ..."
✅ "Let's support Sarah during this time"
```

**What NOT to share:**
```
❌ Specific medical details
❌ Personal family information
❌ Anything Sarah hasn't approved
```

**Best practice:** Get Sarah's input on communication

---

### 4. Smooth Return

**Week before return:**
```
1. Check-in call
   - Confirm date
   - Discuss any schedule flexibility needs
   - Review what changed during leave

2. Pipeline prep
   - Which accounts to return
   - New leads to assign
   - Coverage deals to transition back

3. Team communication
   - "Sarah returns Monday, transitioning back..."
```

**First week back:**
```
- Part-time option (if needed)
- Catch-up meetings
- No immediate quota pressure
- Manager support
```

---

### 5. Account for Return Ramp

**Don't assume 100% capacity Day 1:**

```
Month 1 back: 75% capacity (catching up)
Month 2 back: 90% capacity (building pipeline)
Month 3 back: 100% capacity (fully ramped)

Planning:
  If Sarah returns April 1:
    April: $1.4M × 75% / 12 = $88K
    May: $1.4M × 90% / 12 = $105K
    June: $1.4M × 100% / 12 = $117K

  Q2 Total: $310K (vs $350K = 89% of full quarter)
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Backfilling LOA Like Attrition

**Mistake:**
```
Sarah goes on 12-week leave
Hire full-time backfill AE
Sarah returns, now have extra person
```

**Fix:**
```
Temp coverage or redistribution for LOA
Permanent backfills only for attrition
```

---

### 2. No Coverage Plan

**Mistake:**
```
Sarah leaves → No plan → Pipeline goes cold → Deals lost
```

**Fix:**
```
Coverage plan finalized 2+ weeks before leave
Transition calls with key customers
Clear ownership of each deal
```

---

### 3. Overloading Remaining Team

**Mistake:**
```
Sarah's 10 deals → Pile all onto Mark
Mark now has 20 deals, overwhelmed, performance drops
```

**Fix:**
```
Distribute across multiple team members
2-3 deals each = manageable
Monitor for overload
```

---

### 4. Ignoring LOA in Capacity Reports

**Mistake:**
```
Q1 Capacity Report:
  BOQ: $11M
  Attrition: -$5M
  EOQ: $6M

(Missing: LOA impact of -$350K)
```

**Fix:**
```
Capacity Report:
  BOQ: $11M
  Attrition: -$5M (permanent)
  LOA: -$350K (temporary, returns Q2)
  EOQ: $5.65M
```

**Why:** Accurate capacity reporting for planning

---

### 5. Poor Return Planning

**Mistake:**
```
Sarah returns → Dumped into full quota immediately → Overwhelmed
```

**Fix:**
```
Ramp-back plan:
  - Weeks 1-2: Catching up, pipeline review
  - Weeks 3-4: New leads assigned
  - Month 2: Full capacity restored
```

---

## Legal Considerations

**IMPORTANT:** Consult HR/Legal for compliance

### FMLA (US)

- 12 weeks unpaid leave (job protection)
- Eligible: 12+ months tenure, 1,250+ hours worked
- Reasons: Birth, adoption, serious health condition

**Sales Ops role:** Track leave, ensure capacity planning doesn't pressure employee

---

### State/Provincial Laws

- CA, NY, WA: Paid family leave
- Canada: 12-18 months parental leave
- EU: Country-specific parental leave laws

**Sales Ops role:** Adjust capacity planning by geography
