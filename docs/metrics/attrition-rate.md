# Attrition Rate

## Definition

**Attrition Rate** measures the percentage of sales capacity lost to turnover (voluntary and involuntary departures) over a given period.

## Why It Matters

- Quantifies team stability and turnover impact
- Drives hiring urgency and capacity planning
- Benchmarks against industry standards
- Predicts future capacity risk
- Reveals organizational health issues

## Formula

### Basic Formula

```
Attrition Rate = (Capacity Lost to Attrition / Beginning of Period Capacity) × 100%
```

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:**
- Q4 Beginning Capacity: $11.0M
- Q4 Attrition: $5.0M (5 people left)
- Q4 Attrition Rate: $5.0M / $11.0M = **45.5%**

This means 45.5% of the starting capacity was lost to attrition during the quarter.

## Time Periods

### Quarterly Attrition Rate

```
Quarterly Rate = (Q Attrition / Q Beginning Capacity) × 100%
```

**Use for:** Short-term capacity planning, immediate hiring needs

### Annual Attrition Rate

```
Annual Rate = (Annual Attrition / Average Capacity) × 100%
```

**Use for:** Long-term trends, benchmarking, strategic planning

### Annualized Quarterly Rate

To compare a single quarter to annual benchmarks:

```
Annualized Rate = Quarterly Rate × 4
```

**Example:** 12% quarterly rate → 48% annualized (very high!)

## Industry Benchmarks

| Attrition Level | Annual Rate | Quarterly Rate |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Low** | < 15% | < 4% |
| **Average** | 15-20% | 4-5% |
| **Above Average** | 20-30% | 5-7.5% |
| **High** | 30%+ | 7.5%+ |
| **Critical** | 40%+ | 10%+ |

**Industry Average (SaaS Sales):** ~13.1% annually, ~3.3% quarterly

## Worked Example

### Company: North America East Territory

**Q1 2025:**
- Beginning Capacity: $17.0M (15 people)
- Attrition: $2.0M (2 people)
- **Attrition Rate: 11.8%**

**Q2 2025:**
- Beginning Capacity: $15.3M (13 people)
- Attrition: $2.3M (3 people)
- **Attrition Rate: 15.0%**

**Q3 2025:**
- Beginning Capacity: $13.3M (11 people)
- Attrition: $2.5M (3 people)
- **Attrition Rate: 18.8%**

**Q4 2025:**
- Beginning Capacity: $11.1M (9 people)
- Attrition: $5.0M (5 people)
- **Attrition Rate: 45.5%** ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Full Year 2025:**
- Total Attrition: $11.8M
- Average Capacity: $14.2M
- **Annual Attrition Rate: 83%** 🚨 CRISIS

## What Drives Attrition Rate?

### Organizational Factors:
- Compensation below market
- Poor management or culture
- Lack of career progression
- Unrealistic quotas
- Inadequate training/support

### External Factors:
- Market conditions (hot job market)
- Competitor recruiting
- Industry consolidation
- Remote work opportunities

### Natural Factors:
- Retirements
- Relocations
- Career changes
- Performance terminations

## Impact on Capacity Planning

### High Attrition = Chronic Understaffing

Even if you backfill immediately:
- New hires start at 0% capacity
- Take 5+ months to reach full productivity
- Meanwhile, more people leave
- Creates a "hiring treadmill"

### Recovery Lag Effect

```
Attrition Rate: 40% annually
Average Recovery Lag: 6 months
→ You're always 6 months behind target capacity
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Track Monthly

Don't wait for quarterly reviews. Monitor departures in real-time.

### 2. Segment by Cohort

| Segment | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|
| **By Tenure** | Are new hires leaving or veterans? |
| **By Performance** | Losing top performers or bottom performers? |
| **By Manager** | Is one team experiencing high attrition? |
| **By Territory** | Are certain regions more challenging? |

### 3. Set Acceptable Thresholds

Example policy:
- **Target:** < 15% annual attrition
- **Yellow Flag:** 15-25% (investigate)
- **Red Flag:** > 25% (immediate action required)

### 4. Calculate "Acceptable" Attrition

Not all attrition is bad. Some is inevitable and healthy:
- Performance terminations (bottom 5-10%)
- Promotions out of role
- Retirements

**Healthy Attrition:** ~8-10% annually

## Common Pitfalls

- **Measuring headcount attrition instead of capacity attrition** (losing a top performer ≠ losing a bottom performer)
- **Not accounting for leaves of absence** (temporary vs permanent loss)
- **Comparing quarterly to annual benchmarks** (without annualizing)
- **Ignoring seasonality** (Q1 often has higher attrition)
