# Sales Efficiency Ratio

## Definition

**Sales Efficiency Ratio** measures how much revenue growth you generate per dollar of sales and marketing spend. It quantifies the ROI of your go-to-market investments.

## Formula

### Basic Formula

```
Sales Efficiency Ratio = New ARR (or Revenue Growth) / Sales & Marketing Spend
```

**Example:**
```
New ARR added: $10M
S&M Spend: $5M
Sales Efficiency Ratio: $10M / $5M = 2.0x
```

**Interpretation:** For every $1 spent on S&M, you generated $2 of new ARR.

## Common Variants

### 1. Magic Number (Most Common)

```
Magic Number = (Q Revenue Growth × 4) / Prior Q S&M Spend
```

**Example:**
```
Q4 2025 Revenue: $12M
Q3 2025 Revenue: $10M
Q3 2025 S&M Spend: $4M

Magic Number = (($12M - $10M) × 4) / $4M = 2.0x
```

**Why × 4?** Annualizes quarterly growth

---

### 2. CAC Payback Period

```
CAC Payback = S&M Spend / (New ARR × Gross Margin %)
```

**Example:**
```
S&M Spend: $5M
New ARR: $10M
Gross Margin: 80%

CAC Payback = $5M / ($10M × 80%) = 0.625 years (7.5 months)
```

---

### 3. LTV/CAC Ratio

```
LTV/CAC = (Customer Lifetime Value) / (Customer Acquisition Cost)
```

## Benchmarks

| Magic Number | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| **< 0.5** | Inefficient, reevaluate GTM |
| **0.5-0.75** | Below average, need improvement |
| **0.75-1.0** | Good, healthy growth |
| **1.0-1.5** | Excellent, best-in-class |
| **> 1.5** | Exceptional (or under-investing) |

**SaaS Industry Average:** 0.7-0.9x

## Capacity Planning Connection

### Relationship to Capacity

```
Sales Efficiency = f(Capacity Utilization, Productivity, Sales Cycle)
```

**If capacity is below target:**
- Fewer reps selling
- Lower revenue growth
- Higher S&M spend per dollar of ARR
- **Lower efficiency ratio**

**Example:**
```
Scenario A (Full Capacity):
  - 50 RRE, 100% capacity utilization
  - $50M new ARR, $25M S&M spend
  - Efficiency: 2.0x

Scenario B (30% Below Capacity):
  - 35 RRE, 70% capacity utilization
  - $35M new ARR, $25M S&M spend (still paying for infrastructure)
  - Efficiency: 1.4x

Result: 30% capacity shortfall → 30% lower efficiency
```
