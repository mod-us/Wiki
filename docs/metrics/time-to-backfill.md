# Time to Backfill

## Definition

**Time to Backfill** measures the average number of days (or months) between when an employee departs and when their backfill hire officially starts work.

## Formula

```
Time to Backfill = Backfill Start Date - Termination Date
```

**Measured in:** Days, weeks, or months

---

## Worked Example

**Scenario:**
- Tom terminates: September 30
- Backfill offer accepted: November 15
- Backfill start date: November 30

```
Time to Backfill = Nov 30 - Sept 30 = 60 days (2 months)
```

## Reducing Time to Backfill

### Strategy 1: Pre-Approve Backfills

**Before:**
```
Termination → Approval (14 days) → Recruiting (42 days) → Start
Total: 56 days
```

**After:**
```
Termination → Recruiting (42 days) → Start
Total: 42 days
Saved: 14 days (25% faster)
```

### Strategy 2: Evergreen Pipeline

**Before:**
```
Termination → Post job → Source → Screen → Interview → Offer (42 days)
```

**After:**
```
Termination → Interview warm pipeline → Offer (21 days)
Saved: 21 days (50% faster)
```

### Strategy 3: Competitive Offers

**Before:**
```
First offer declined → Second candidate (add 21 days)
Total: 63 days
```

**After:**
```
First offer accepted (strong compensation)
Total: 42 days
Saved: 21 days
```

## Impact on Capacity

**Example:**

Tom's capacity: $1.4M annual ($350K quarterly)

| Time to Backfill | Vacancy Period | Revenue at Risk |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **30 days** | 1 month | $117K |
| **60 days** | 2 months | $233K |
| **90 days** | 3 months | $350K |

**Every 30-day delay = $117K more revenue at risk**
