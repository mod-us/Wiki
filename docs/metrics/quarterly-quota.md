# Quarterly Quota

## Definition

**Quarterly Quota** is the revenue target assigned to a sales rep for a single quarter, typically one-fourth of their annual quota (adjusted for ramp if applicable).

## Formula

### For Fully Ramped Reps

```
Quarterly Quota = Annual Quota / 4
```

**Example:**
```
Annual Quota: $1.2M
Quarterly Quota: $1.2M / 4 = $300K
```

---

### For Ramping Reps

```
Quarterly Quota = (Annual Quota / 4) × Ramp %
```

**Example:**
```
Rep at 50% ramp
Annual Quota: $1.2M
Quarterly Quota: ($1.2M / 4) × 50% = $150K
```

---

## Why Quarterly Quotas Matter

### 1. Capacity Planning

```
Target Capacity (Quarterly) = Σ (Rep Quarterly Quotas)
```

**Example Team:**
- 10 fully ramped reps × $300K = $3.0M
- 3 ramping reps × $150K = $0.45M
- **Total Quarterly Capacity: $3.45M**

---

### 2. Revenue Forecasting

```
Quarterly Revenue Forecast = Team Quarterly Capacity × Expected Attainment %
```

**Example:**
```
Quarterly Capacity: $3.45M
Expected Attainment: 85%
Forecast: $3.45M × 85% = $2.93M
```

---

### 3. Gap Analysis

```
Gap to Target (Quarterly) = Target Capacity - Current Capacity
```

**Example:**
```
Target: $10M quarterly
Current: $7M quarterly
Gap: $3M (30% short)
Need: $3M / $300K = 10 more fully ramped reps
```

## Standard Quota by Role

| Role | Typical Annual | Typical Quarterly |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **SDR** | $400K-$600K pipeline | $100K-$150K |
| **SMB AE** | $800K-$1.0M | $200K-$250K |
| **Mid-Market AE** | $1.0M-$1.5M | $250K-$375K |
| **Enterprise AE** | $1.5M-$3.0M | $375K-$750K |
| **Manager** | $5M-$10M (team) | $1.25M-$2.5M |

**Note:** Varies widely by company, industry, product price

## Ramp-Adjusted Quarterly Quotas

### Month-by-Month Quota Assignment

**Rep starts Month 1 of Q1:**

| Month | Ramp % | Monthly Quota | Calculation |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Month 1 | 0% | $0 | $100K × 0% |
| Month 2 | 25% | $25K | $100K × 25% |
| Month 3 | 50% | $50K | $100K × 50% |
| **Q1 Total** | **25%** | **$75K** | **vs $300K full** |

**Note:** Q1 quota is reduced to reflect ramp period

## Quota Capacity in Capacity Waterfalls

**Example:**

```
Beginning of Quarter Capacity: $10.0M
  ├─ 30 fully ramped reps × $300K = $9.0M
  └─ 4 ramping reps × $150K (50% avg) = $0.6M
  └─ 1 new hire × $25K (Month 2 ramp) = $0.025M
  └─ Total: 35 people, $9.625M capacity
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Not Adjusting for Ramp

**Mistake:**
```
New hire in Month 1: Assign $300K quarterly quota
Result: Rep misses badly (was at 0% ramp)
```

**Correct:**
```
New hire in Month 1: Assign $75K quarterly quota (ramp-adjusted)
Result: Realistic expectations
```

---

### 2. Treating All Quarters Equal

**Mistake:**
```
Annual quota: $1.2M
Q1 quota: $300K (but rep started Month 2)
Result: Impossible target
```

**Correct:**
```
Q1 quota: $200K (2 months at partial ramp)
Q2-Q4 quota: $300K each (fully ramped)
```

---

### 3. Using Annual Quotas in Capacity Planning

**Mistake:**
```
"We have $50M of annual quota capacity"
For quarterly planning: $50M / 4 = $12.5M
```

**Problem:** Doesn't account for who's ramping THIS quarter

**Correct:**
```
Sum each rep's QUARTERLY quota (ramp-adjusted)
= Accurate quarterly capacity
```
