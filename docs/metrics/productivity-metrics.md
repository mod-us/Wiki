# Productivity Metrics

## Definition

**Productivity Metrics** measure individual and team output relative to capacity. They help assess whether reps are performing at expected levels and identify coaching opportunities.

---

## Key Productivity Metrics

### 1. Revenue per Rep

```
Revenue per Rep = Total Revenue / Number of Reps
```

**Example:**
```
Team Revenue: $50M
Team Size: 50 reps
Revenue per Rep: $1M
```

**Benchmark:** Compare to quota ($1.2M) → Team is at 83% productivity

---

### 2. Revenue per RRE

```
Revenue per RRE = Total Revenue / Total RRE
```

**Example:**
```
Team Revenue: $50M
Team Capacity: 42.5 RRE (accounting for ramp)
Revenue per RRE: $1.18M
```

**Why better than revenue per rep:** Accounts for ramp time

---

### 3. Quota Attainment %

```
Quota Attainment = Actual Revenue / Assigned Quota × 100%
```

**Distribution matters:**

| Attainment Range | % of Team | Interpretation |
|------------------|-----------|----------------|
| < 50% | 10% | Bottom performers |
| 50-80% | 20% | Below expectations |
| 80-120% | 50% | Core performers |
| 120%+ | 20% | Top performers |

**Healthy team:** Bell curve centered at 90-100%

---

### 4. Pipeline Coverage

```
Pipeline Coverage = Current Pipeline / Quarterly Quota
```

**Example:**
```
Rep's Quarterly Quota: $300K
Current Pipeline: $900K
Coverage: 3x
```

**Benchmarks:**
- < 2x: At risk
- 2-3x: Healthy
- \> 4x: Either overperforming or poor close rate

---

### 5. Win Rate

```
Win Rate = Deals Won / (Deals Won + Deals Lost) × 100%
```

**Benchmarks by role:**
- SDR → Meeting conversion: 20-30%
- AE → Opp-to-close: 25-35%
- Enterprise AE → Opp-to-close: 15-25%

---

## Capacity Planning Connection

### Productivity Impacts Capacity Needs

**Scenario A: High Productivity (100% attainment)**
```
Revenue Target: $50M
Required Capacity: $50M / 100% = $50M (50 RRE at $1M each)
```

**Scenario B: Low Productivity (75% attainment)**
```
Revenue Target: $50M
Required Capacity: $50M / 75% = $66.7M (67 RRE at $1M each)
Need 34% MORE capacity!
```
