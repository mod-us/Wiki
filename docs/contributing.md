# Contributing to Sales Wiki

Thank you for contributing to Sales Wiki! This guide explains how to submit new terms, edit existing content, and participate in the community.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Edit on GitHub (Preferred)

Click **"Edit this page"** at the bottom of any doc page to:
- Fix typos or errors
- Add examples or clarifications
- Update formulas or references
- Propose new content

This opens a pull request (PR) on GitHub.

### 2. Submit via Form

Don't have GitHub? Use the **"Suggest an edit"** link to submit feedback via a form. We'll convert it into an issue or PR.

### 3. Propose New Terms

Open an issue on GitHub with:
- **Term name**
- **Category** (Metric, Capacity, Playbook, etc.)
- **Why it matters** (1-2 sentences)
- **Draft definition** (optional but helpful)

## Content Standards

Every term page must include:

### Required Sections

1. **Definition**: Clear, concise explanation (2-3 sentences)
2. **Why It Matters**: Business impact and use cases
3. **Formula**: Exact calculation with variants documented
4. **Example Calculation**: Worked example with real numbers
5. **Related Terms**: Links to 2-5 related wiki pages

### Optional Sections

- **Best Practices**: Practical implementation guidance
- **Common Pitfalls**: Mistakes to avoid
- **Variants**: Different calculation methods
- **References**: External resources

## Writing Guidelines

### Be Explicit
❌ "Adjust headcount for ramp"
✅ "Multiply headcount by ramp percentage (e.g., 3 reps × 60% = 1.8 RRE)"

### Show Your Work
Include full calculation steps in examples.

### Use Tables
For multi-row calculations, use markdown tables.

### Define Acronyms
Always spell out acronyms on first use.

### Neutral Tone
No marketing speak. No vendor names unless necessary.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repo** (or use GitHub's web editor)
2. **Make your changes** following the content standards above
3. **Submit PR** with a clear title (e.g., "Add CAC Payback Period term")
4. **Respond to feedback** from reviewers
5. **Merge**: Once approved, maintainers will merge

## Review Criteria

Reviewers check for:
- ✅ Accuracy of formulas and definitions
- ✅ Clarity and readability
- ✅ Worked examples with realistic numbers
- ✅ Proper formatting and links
- ✅ Neutral, non-promotional tone
