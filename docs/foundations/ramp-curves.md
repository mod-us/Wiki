# Ramp Curves

## Definition

A **Ramp Curve** is a model that describes how a new sales hire's productivity increases over time, from 0% on day one to 100% (fully ramped) after several months of onboarding and experience.

## Why Ramp Curves Matter

New hires don't produce at full capacity immediately. They need time to:
- Learn products, pricing, positioning
- Understand customer personas and pain points
- Build pipeline (prospecting takes time)
- Develop sales skills and objection handling
- Learn internal systems and processes

**Without accounting for ramp:**
- Revenue forecasts are overstated
- Quota targets are unrealistic
- Capacity planning fails

**With ramp curves:**
- Accurate capacity forecasting
- Realistic quota assignment
- Better hiring decisions

## Standard Ramp Curve

The most common ramp schedule for B2B Account Executives:

| Month | Ramp % | What's Happening |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Month 1** | 0% | Training, shadowing, learning products |
| **Month 2** | 25% | First deals, light prospecting, building pipeline |
| **Month 3** | 50% | Active selling, half quota assignment |
| **Month 4** | 75% | Near-full quota, pipeline maturing |
| **Month 5+** | 100% | Fully ramped, full quota |

**Time to full productivity: 5 months**

## Ramp Curves by Role

Different roles have different ramp speeds:

### SDR/BDR (Fast Ramp)

| Month | Ramp % | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | 0% | Training, scripts, tools |
| 2 | 50% | Simpler motion, faster ramp |
| 3 | 75% | Pipeline building |
| 4+ | 100% | Fully ramped |

**Time to 100%: 3-4 months**

**Why faster?**
- Simpler sale (discovery, qualification)
- Scripted outreach
- Less product complexity
- Shorter sales cycles

---

### Mid-Market AE (Standard Ramp)

| Month | Ramp % | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | 0% | Training, product learning |
| 2 | 25% | First deals |
| 3 | 50% | Half quota |
| 4 | 75% | Near-full quota |
| 5+ | 100% | Fully ramped |

**Time to 100%: 5 months**

**Why standard?**
- Moderate complexity
- 30-60 day sales cycles
- Territory learning required
- Multi-stakeholder sales

---

### Enterprise AE (Slow Ramp)

| Month | Ramp % | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1-2 | 0% | Training, enterprise process learning |
| 3 | 15% | Shadowing senior AEs |
| 4 | 30% | First enterprise deals (long cycles) |
| 5 | 45% | Building strategic relationships |
| 6 | 60% | Pipeline maturation |
| 7 | 75% | First major closes |
| 8 | 85% | Near-full productivity |
| 9+ | 100% | Fully ramped |

**Time to 100%: 9 months**

**Why slower?**
- Complex technical sales
- 6-12 month sales cycles
- Strategic account planning
- C-level relationship building
- Requires deep product/industry expertise

---

### Sales Manager (Very Slow Ramp)

| Month | Ramp % | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1-3 | 0% | Team building, relationship building |
| 4-6 | 25% | Coaching systems, pipeline review |
| 7-9 | 50% | Team performance improving |
| 10-12 | 75% | Full team productivity |
| 13+ | 100% | Fully ramped team |

**Time to 100%: 12+ months**

**Why slowest?**
- Managing people, not selling
- Team performance lags individual ramp
- Culture and process changes take time
- Inherited pipeline and team issues

## How to Build Your Own Ramp Curve

### Step 1: Gather Historical Data

For the last 12-24 months of hires, track:
- **Hire date**
- **First deal close date**
- **Monthly quota attainment %** (Months 1-12)

### Step 2: Calculate Average Attainment by Tenure

```
Month 1 Avg: Σ (All Month 1 attainments) / # of hires
Month 2 Avg: Σ (All Month 2 attainments) / # of hires
...
Month 12 Avg: Σ (All Month 12 attainments) / # of hires
```

**Example data:**

| Tenure | Hire 1 | Hire 2 | Hire 3 | Hire 4 | Average | Ramp % |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Month 1 | 0% | 0% | 5% | 0% | 1.25% | **0%** |
| Month 2 | 15% | 20% | 30% | 25% | 22.5% | **25%** |
| Month 3 | 45% | 50% | 55% | 48% | 49.5% | **50%** |
| Month 4 | 70% | 75% | 80% | 72% | 74.25% | **75%** |
| Month 5 | 95% | 100% | 105% | 98% | 99.5% | **100%** |

### Step 3: Smooth the Curve

Real data is noisy. Round to standard increments:
- **0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%** (most common)
- Or: **0%, 15%, 30%, 45%, 60%, 75%, 90%, 100%** (more granular)

### Step 4: Validate with Managers

Ask sales managers:
- "Does this match your experience?"
- "Are there seasonal differences?" (Q1 vs Q4 ramps)
- "Do onboarding improvements change ramp speed?"

### Step 5: Codify and Communicate

Document the official ramp curve for each role:
- Use in capacity planning models
- Share with new hires (set expectations)
- Track actuals vs curve (identify at-risk hires)

## Using Ramp Curves in Capacity Planning

### Example: Hiring 3 AEs in Q1

**Scenario:**
- 3 AEs hired, all starting Month 1 of Q1
- Annual quota: $1.2M per rep
- Ramp curve: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%

**Quarterly capacity contribution:**

```
Q1 (Months 1-3):
  Month 1: 3 reps × $100K × 0% = $0
  Month 2: 3 reps × $100K × 25% = $75K
  Month 3: 3 reps × $100K × 50% = $150K
  Q1 Total: $225K

Q2 (Months 4-6):
  Month 4: 3 reps × $100K × 75% = $225K
  Month 5-6: 3 reps × $100K × 100% × 2 = $600K
  Q2 Total: $825K

Q3-Q4 (Fully ramped):
  Each quarter: 3 reps × $300K = $900K
```

**Key insight:** 3 hires in Q1 only contribute $225K in Q1, but $900K per quarter once fully ramped.

## Variations in Ramp Speed

### Factors That Accelerate Ramp

1. **Better Onboarding**
   - Structured training programs
   - Manager shadowing
   - Deal mentorship
   - Warm territory handoffs

**Impact:** Cut 5-month ramp to 4 months

2. **Experienced Hires**
   - Industry veterans
   - Competitive hires
   - Former customers/partners

**Impact:** Cut 5-month ramp to 3 months

3. **Simpler Products**
   - Fewer SKUs
   - Shorter sales cycles
   - Less technical complexity

**Impact:** Cut 5-month ramp to 3-4 months

4. **Strong Enablement**
   - Pre-built playbooks
   - Battle cards
   - Demo environments
   - CRM setup

**Impact:** Cut 5-month ramp to 4 months

---

### Factors That Slow Ramp

1. **Poor Onboarding**
   - "Figure it out yourself" culture
   - No structured training
   - Overwhelmed managers

**Impact:** 5-month ramp becomes 7-8 months

2. **Inexperienced Hires**
   - First sales job
   - Career changers
   - Wrong background

**Impact:** 5-month ramp becomes 8-12 months (or never)

3. **Complex Products**
   - Technical/enterprise sales
   - Multi-product portfolios
   - Custom implementations

**Impact:** 5-month ramp becomes 9-12 months

4. **Weak Pipeline Inheritance**
   - No territory handoff
   - Cold accounts
   - Competitive losses

**Impact:** 5-month ramp becomes 7-9 months

## Monitoring Ramp Performance

### Individual Rep Tracking

**Red Flags:**

| Month | Expected Ramp | Red Flag Threshold |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| 2 | 25% | < 10% attainment |
| 3 | 50% | < 30% attainment |
| 4 | 75% | < 50% attainment |
| 5 | 100% | < 75% attainment |

**Action:** If rep is >25 percentage points below curve, intervene:
- Manager coaching
- Additional training
- Peer mentorship
- Performance improvement plan (if severe)

### Cohort Analysis

Track ramp performance by hire cohort:

**Example:**

| Cohort | Avg Month 3 Ramp | Avg Month 5 Ramp | Full Ramp Time |
|--------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Q1 2024 | 45% | 95% | 5 months ✓ |
| Q2 2024 | 48% | 98% | 5 months ✓ |
| Q3 2024 | 35% | 78% | 7 months ⚠️ |
| Q4 2024 | 30% | 70% | 8+ months ❌ |

**Insight:** Q3/Q4 cohorts are ramping slower. Investigate:
- Did onboarding quality degrade?
- Seasonal hiring challenges?
- Wrong profiles hired?

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Ramp Curves in Quota Setting

**Don't:**
> "You're hired March 1. Your annual quota is $1.2M."

**Do:**
> "You're hired March 1. Your Q1 quota is $75K (partial ramp), Q2 is $225K, Q3+ is $300K."

### 2. Update Curves Annually

Ramp speed changes over time:
- Product complexity changes
- Onboarding improves (or degrades)
- Market conditions shift

**Review annually:** Does the curve still match reality?

### 3. Segment by Role

Don't use one ramp curve for SDRs and Enterprise AEs. Build role-specific curves.

### 4. Account for Seasonality

Q4 hires may ramp slower (holidays, year-end chaos).
Q1 hires may ramp faster (fresh budgets, kick-off energy).

### 5. Communicate Expectations

Share ramp curve with new hires:
> "Month 1-2 is learning. You'll carry 50% quota starting Month 3, full quota by Month 5."

Sets realistic expectations, reduces anxiety.

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Assuming Instant Productivity

**Mistake:** "We hired 10 reps in Q1, so we have 10 RRE of capacity in Q1."

**Reality:** Those 10 reps contribute ~2.5 RRE in Q1 (25% avg ramp).

### 2. Using Headcount Instead of Capacity

**Mistake:** "We're at headcount target, so we're good."

**Reality:** If 40% of team is ramping, you're well below capacity target.

### 3. Not Updating the Curve

**Mistake:** Using a 2020 ramp curve in 2025 without validation.

**Reality:** Your product, onboarding, and market have changed.

### 4. Ignoring Outliers

**Mistake:** One rockstar ramped in 2 months, so all reps should.

**Reality:** Plan for the average, not the exception.
