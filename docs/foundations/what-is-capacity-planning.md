# What is Capacity Planning?

## Definition

**Capacity Planning** is the strategic process of forecasting, measuring, and managing the amount of selling capacity your sales organization can deliver to meet revenue targets.

## The Core Question

> **"Do we have enough sellers, at the right productivity levels, to hit our revenue goals?"**

Capacity planning answers this question with data, not guesses.

## Why Traditional Headcount Planning Fails

### The Old Way (Headcount Planning)

```
Revenue Target: $50M
Average Quota: $1M per rep
Math: $50M / $1M = 50 reps needed
Conclusion: "Hire 50 AEs"
```

**Problem:** This assumes:
- ❌ All 50 reps are fully ramped
- ❌ All 50 reps hit 100% attainment
- ❌ Zero attrition during the year
- ❌ Everyone starts on January 1

### The New Way (Capacity Planning)

```
Revenue Target: $50M
Average Quota: $1M per rep

But account for:
✓ Ramp time: 30% of team ramping at 50% avg
✓ Attrition: 15% annual turnover
✓ Attainment: 85% average (not 100%)
✓ Staggered start dates

Actual capacity needed: ~65 RRE
Required hiring: 75-80 people (accounting for ramp and attrition)
```

**Result:** More accurate, more achievable.

## The Three Pillars of Capacity Planning

### 1. Measuring Current Capacity

**Not:** "How many people do we have?"
**But:** "How much can they actually sell?"

```
Current Capacity = Σ (Employees × Ramp % × Expected Attainment)
```

**Example:**
- 20 fully ramped reps at 85% attainment = 17.0 effective RRE
- 5 ramping reps (avg 50% ramp) at 70% attainment = 1.75 effective RRE
- **Total: 18.75 RRE** (not 25)

### 2. Forecasting Future Capacity

**Account for:**
- **Ramp progression:** Existing reps moving from 60% → 85% → 100%
- **Expected attrition:** Historical turnover rates applied forward
- **Planned hires:** New reps with realistic start dates and ramp schedules
- **Leaves of absence:** Temporary capacity reductions

**Example projection:**
```
Q1 2026 Start: 18.75 RRE
  + Ramp progression: +2.5 RRE
  - Expected attrition: -2.0 RRE
  + New hire contributions: +1.5 RRE (partial quarter)
= Q1 2026 End: 20.75 RRE
```

### 3. Managing the Gap

**Identify and close capacity gaps:**

```
Gap = Target Capacity - Current Capacity
```

**If positive (shortfall):** Hire more, accelerate ramp, reduce attrition
**If negative (surplus):** Slow hiring, reallocate resources, adjust targets

## Key Inputs to Capacity Planning

### Historical Data
- **Attrition rates** (by role, tenure, manager)
- **Ramp curves** (time to productivity by role)
- **Attainment distribution** (actual performance vs quota)
- **Time to hire** (how long to fill roles)

### Future Plans
- **Revenue targets** (quarterly and annual)
- **Market expansion** (new territories, segments)
- **Product launches** (new offerings requiring capacity)
- **Strategic initiatives** (new sales motions)

### Current State
- **Active headcount** (who's here today)
- **Open requisitions** (approved but not filled)
- **Pipeline candidates** (offers extended, start dates confirmed)
- **Planned departures** (known retirements, transfers)

## Key Outputs of Capacity Planning

### 1. Capacity Dashboard

**Metrics tracked:**
- Current Capacity vs Target
- Gap to Target
- Attrition Rate
- Capacity at Risk (next quarter prediction)
- Recovery Lag

### 2. Hiring Plan

**12-month forward view:**
- Number of hires needed per quarter
- Expected start dates
- Ramp schedules
- Capacity contribution timeline

### 3. Capacity Forecast

**4-quarter rolling projection:**
- Beginning of Quarter (BoQ) capacity
- Expected attrition
- Planned hiring contributions
- End of Quarter (EoQ) capacity
- Gap trajectory

### 4. Scenario Models

**What-if analysis:**
- Optimistic: Low attrition (10%), fast ramp
- Baseline: Historical averages (15% attrition)
- Conservative: High attrition (20%), slow ramp

## The Quarterly Capacity Planning Cycle

### Month 1: Assess & Diagnose
**Week 1:** Measure current capacity
**Week 2:** Calculate gap to target
**Week 3:** Analyze root causes (attrition, ramp, unfilled roles)
**Week 4:** Review with leadership

### Month 2: Plan & Forecast
**Week 1:** Predict next quarter attrition (Capacity at Risk)
**Week 2:** Model ramp progression and new hire contributions
**Week 3:** Build hiring plan (roles, start dates, ramp schedules)
**Week 4:** Create 4-quarter capacity forecast

### Month 3: Execute & Track
**Week 1:** Approve hiring plan and backfills
**Week 2:** Launch recruiting for planned hires
**Week 3:** Track actuals vs plan (attrition, hiring progress)
**Week 4:** Update forecast, prepare for next quarter

## Who Owns Capacity Planning?

### Primary Owner: RevOps / Sales Operations

**Responsibilities:**
- Build and maintain capacity models

- Produce quarterly capacity forecasts
- Partner with recruiting on hiring timelines

### Key Partners

**Sales Leadership:**
- Set revenue targets
- Approve hiring plans
- Manage attrition (retention strategies)
- Own team performance (attainment)

**Finance:**
- Budget for headcount growth
- Model revenue impact of capacity gaps
- Track capacity ROI (revenue per RRE)

**Recruiting/HR:**
- Execute hiring plans
- Report time-to-hire metrics
- Manage onboarding and ramp programs

## Capacity Planning vs Other Planning Types

| Planning Type | Focus | Horizon | Key Metric |
|--------------|-------|---------|------------|
| **Capacity Planning** | Selling capacity | 4 quarters | RRE, Gap to Target |
| **Headcount Planning** | Number of people | Annual | Headcount |
| **Workforce Planning** | Org structure | 1-3 years | Spans, levels |
| **Territory Planning** | Coverage allocation | 6-12 months | Accounts per rep |
| **Quota Planning** | Revenue targets | Annual | Quota attainment |

## Real-World Example: SaaS Company

### Situation
- **Current State:** 50 AEs, 42.5 RRE effective capacity
- **Revenue Target:** $50M annually
- **Problem:** $50M / $1M quota per rep = 50 RRE needed
- **Gap:** 7.5 RRE shortfall (15% below target)

### Capacity Plan

**Q1 Actions:**
- Hire 8 AEs (4 backfills for Q4 attrition, 4 growth)
- Start dates: 4 in Month 1, 4 in Month 2

**Q1 Outcome:**
- BoQ: 42.5 RRE
- Attrition: -3.2 RRE (15% quarterly rate)
- Ramp progression: +2.1 RRE (existing reps advancing)
- New hires: +0.8 RRE (partial quarter, still ramping)
- **EoQ: 42.2 RRE** (gap widened slightly)

**Q2-Q4 Trajectory:**
- Q2 EoQ: 44.5 RRE (new hires ramping up)
- Q3 EoQ: 47.8 RRE (getting close)
- Q4 EoQ: 51.2 RRE (✓ target achieved)

**Key Insight:** Took 4 quarters to close a 15% gap, even with aggressive hiring.

## Common Misconceptions

### Myth 1: "Capacity planning is just counting people"
**Reality:** Counting people = headcount. Measuring productivity-weighted capacity = capacity planning.

### Myth 2: "We'll hit the target if we hire to headcount plan"
**Reality:** Headcount doesn't account for ramp, attrition, or attainment variance.

### Myth 3: "Capacity planning is only for large companies"
**Reality:** Even a 10-person sales team benefits from understanding ramp and attrition impact.

### Myth 4: "It's too hard to predict attrition"
**Reality:** Historical data provides reliable ranges. Plan for the average, prepare for the worst.

### Myth 5: "We can fix the gap next quarter"
**Reality:** Recovery lag means gaps take 2-4 quarters to close, even with immediate action.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Measure Your Current Capacity (Week 1)

Calculate RRE for your current team:
```
For each employee:
  Annual Quota × Ramp % = Capacity Contribution

Sum all contributions = Current Capacity
```

### Step 2: Calculate Historical Attrition Rate (Week 1)

```
(Last 4 quarters total attrition) / (Average quarterly BoQ capacity) = Attrition Rate
```

### Step 3: Build a Simple Forecast (Week 2)

```
Next Quarter BoQ = This Quarter EoQ
Next Quarter Attrition = BoQ × Attrition Rate
Next Quarter EoQ = BoQ - Attrition + (Planned Hires × Avg Ramp %)
```

### Step 4: Identify Your Gap (Week 2)

```
Gap = Target Capacity - Forecasted EoQ Capacity
```

### Step 5: Build a Hiring Plan (Week 3-4)

```
Hires Needed = Gap / (Avg Quota × Avg Ramp in Quarter 1)
```
