# Headcount vs Capacity

## The Problem

Many sales leaders track **headcount** when they should be tracking **capacity**. These are not the same thing.

**Headcount** = Number of people on the team
**Capacity** = Amount of selling productivity those people can deliver

## Why They're Different

### Example: Two Teams

**Team A:**
- 10 people
- All fully ramped (9+ months tenure)
- Producing at 100% capacity

**Team B:**
- 10 people
- 5 fully ramped (100%)
- 3 at 6 months (60% ramp)
- 2 just started (10% ramp)

Both teams have the same **headcount** (10 people), but very different **capacity**:

| Team | Headcount | Effective Capacity |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Team A | 10 | 10.0 RRE |
| Team B | 10 | 7.0 RRE |

Team B has only 70% of Team A's selling capacity despite having the same number of people.

## The Ramp Problem

New hires don't produce at full capacity immediately. They go through a **ramp period**:

```
Month 1-3:  25% productivity (learning products, processes, territory)
Month 4-6:  60% productivity (building pipeline, closing first deals)
Month 7-9:  85% productivity (hitting stride)
Month 10+:  100% productivity (fully ramped)
```

During this time, they count as "1 headcount" but contribute less than "1.0 capacity."

## Real-World Impact

### Scenario: Hitting Headcount Target

Your plan called for 25 reps by end of Q4. You hit that target exactly. Success?

**Not necessarily.**

If you:
- Started Q4 with 20 fully ramped reps
- Lost 5 reps to attrition mid-quarter
- Hired 10 new reps (5 backfills + 5 net new)

You now have:
- **Headcount:** 25 people ✅
- **Capacity:** 15 fully ramped + 10 ramping at 25% = 17.5 RRE ❌

You're **30% below target capacity** despite hitting headcount target.

## When to Use Each Metric

### Use Headcount For:

- Budget planning (salary costs, seat licenses)
- Org chart reporting (spans of control)
- Recruiting targets ("hire 10 AEs")
- Workspace planning (desks, laptops)

### Use Capacity For:

- **Quota setting** (how much revenue can this team actually produce?)
- **Territory planning** (do we have enough coverage?)
- **Capacity planning** (are we understaffed or overstaffed?)
- **Performance forecasting** (what's realistic attainment?)

## Key Principle

> **"Headcount is who you pay. Capacity is what you get."**

If you plan revenue based on headcount without accounting for ramp, you'll consistently miss forecasts.
