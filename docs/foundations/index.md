# Foundations

## What is the Foundations Section?

The **Foundations section** covers the **fundamental concepts** you need to understand before diving into capacity planning, metrics, and playbooks.

### Focus: "What are the basic building blocks?"

**What it covers:** Core concepts, definitions, and frameworks that underpin sales capacity and performance management

### Why Start Here?

If you're new to sales capacity planning, start with these foundational concepts:

- **Headcount vs Capacity:** Why counting people isn't the same as measuring selling capacity
- **Ramp Curves:** Why new hires don't produce at full capacity immediately
- **Capacity Planning Basics:** The overall framework and why it matters

These concepts are referenced throughout the wiki, so understanding them first will make everything else clearer.
