# Loss Capacity

## Definition

**Loss Capacity** is the total amount of selling capacity that has been lost to attrition (terminations, resignations) and temporary leaves during a measurement period. It represents the revenue-generating potential that departed or absent employees took with them.

## Formula

```
Loss Capacity = Σ (Departed/LOA Employee Annual Quotas)
```

**Includes:**
- Voluntary resignations
- Involuntary terminations
- Leaves of absence (LOA)
- Retirements

**Excludes:**
- Future planned departures (not yet happened)
- Internal transfers (capacity stays in company)

---

## Worked Example: North America East Q4 2025

**Departures during Q4 2025:**

| Employee | Type | Date | Annual Quota | Capacity Lost |
|----------|------|------|--------------|---------------|
| Tom | Resignation | Sept 30 | $1.4M | $1.4M |
| John | Resignation | Oct 15 | $1.2M | $1.2M |
| Mike | Termination | Nov 1 | $1.0M | $1.0M |
| Lisa | Resignation | Nov 15 | $1.4M | $1.4M |
| Sarah | LOA (Parental) | Dec 1 | $1.2M | $1.2M (temporary) |

```
Loss Capacity (Q4) = $1.4M + $1.2M + $1.0M + $1.4M + $1.2M = $6.2M
```

**Note:** Sarah's LOA is temporary loss (she's returning), but still counts as Loss Capacity for Q4.

---

## Loss Capacity vs Other Metrics

### Loss Capacity vs Attrition Rate

```
Loss Capacity = Total capacity lost ($6.2M)
Attrition Rate = Loss / Beginning Capacity
Attrition Rate = $6.2M / $11.0M = 56.4%
```

**Difference:**
- Loss Capacity: Absolute amount lost
- Attrition Rate: Percentage of starting capacity

### Loss Capacity vs Unrecovered Gap

```
Loss Capacity = $6.2M (what we lost)
Recovered (Backfills) = $0.9M (what we regained)
Unrecovered Gap = $6.2M - $0.9M = $5.3M (what remains lost)
```

**Difference:**
- Loss Capacity: Total lost
- Unrecovered Gap: Lost minus recovered

### Loss Capacity vs Revenue Impact

```
Loss Capacity = $6.2M annual quota
Quarterly Impact = $6.2M / 4 = $1.55M per quarter
```

But actual revenue impact depends on:
- When in quarter they left (mid-quarter = partial loss)
- Their actual attainment % (not 100%)
- Whether backfills were hired

---

## Measuring Loss Capacity

### Annual Loss Capacity

Sum all departures across the full year:

```
Q1 Loss: $2.0M
Q2 Loss: $2.3M
Q3 Loss: $2.5M
Q4 Loss: $6.2M
────────────────
Annual Loss Capacity: $13.0M
```

**Interpretation:** Lost $13.0M of annual quota capacity over the year.

### Quarterly Loss Capacity

Focus on a single quarter to understand period-specific impact:

```
Q4 2025 Loss Capacity: $6.2M
Q4 2025 Beginning Capacity: $11.0M
Q4 Attrition Rate: 56.4% (crisis level)
```

### Month-by-Month Loss Tracking

| Month | Departures | Cumulative Loss |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| Sept | 1 (Tom) | $1.4M |
| Oct | 1 (John) | $2.6M |
| Nov | 2 (Mike, Lisa) | $5.0M |
| Dec | 1 (Sarah LOA) | $6.2M |

**Insight:** Loss accelerated in Nov-Dec (holiday season turnover spike)

## Types of Loss Capacity

### 1. Permanent Loss (Attrition)

**Voluntary:**
- Resignations
- Retirements
- Career changes

**Involuntary:**
- Performance terminations
- Layoffs
- Restructuring

**Impact:** Permanent capacity loss, requires backfill to recover

**Example:**
```
Tom resigned: $1.4M permanent loss
→ Need to hire backfill to recover
```

### 2. Temporary Loss (LOA)

**Leave types:**
- Parental leave
- Medical leave
- Sabbatical
- Military leave

**Impact:** Temporary capacity loss, employee returns

**Example:**
```
Sarah on 3-month parental leave: $1.2M temporary loss
→ No backfill needed, capacity returns automatically
→ But still impacts Q4 performance
```

### 3. Partial Loss (Mid-Period Departures)

When employees leave mid-quarter, capacity loss is prorated:

**Example:**
```
John leaves Oct 15 (halfway through Q4)
Annual quota: $1.2M
Q4 quota: $300K
Remaining Q4 capacity lost: ~$150K (half the quarter)
```

**For Loss Capacity tracking:** Still count full annual quota ($1.2M), but note actual Q4 impact is lower.

---

## Why Loss Capacity Matters

### 1. Quantifies Attrition Impact

```
"We lost 5 people in Q4"
→ How bad is that?

"We lost $6.2M of Loss Capacity in Q4"
→ Much clearer impact
```

### 2. Drives Hiring Urgency

```
Loss Capacity: $6.2M
Average Quota: $1.2M
→ Need to hire 5-6 people to replace lost capacity
→ But with ramp, will take 5-6 months to fully recover
```

### 3. Justifies Backfill Budget

```
To Finance: "We need to hire 5 backfills"
Why? "We lost $6.2M of capacity, need to restore it"
Cost: 5 × $120K salary = $600K investment
ROI: Recover $6.2M revenue potential
```

### 4. Reveals Trends

**Year-over-year comparison:**

| Year | Annual Loss Capacity | Trend |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| 2023 | $8.0M | Baseline |
| 2024 | $11.0M | +37.5% worse |
| 2025 | $13.0M | +18% worse |

**Insight:** Attrition problem is accelerating, need retention initiatives

## Tracking Loss Capacity by Segment

### By Role

| Role | Loss Capacity | % of Total |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Enterprise AE | $3.8M | 61% |
| Mid-Market AE | $1.8M | 29% |
| SDR | $0.6M | 10% |

**Insight:** Enterprise AE attrition is disproportionately high

### By Manager

| Manager | Loss Capacity | Team Size | Loss Rate |
|---------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Michael | $4.0M | 6 people | 67% |
| Amanda | $1.2M | 4 people | 30% |
| David | $1.0M | 5 people | 20% |

**Insight:** Michael's team has critical retention issue

### By Reason

| Reason | Loss Capacity | % of Total |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Voluntary (resignation) | $4.0M | 65% |
| Involuntary (termination) | $1.0M | 16% |
| LOA (temporary) | $1.2M | 19% |

**Insight:** Most loss is voluntary turnover (retention problem, not performance)

## Responding to High Loss Capacity

### Immediate Actions

1. **Approve Backfills**
   - Auto-approve backfill budget
   - Start recruiting same-day
   - Set aggressive start date targets

2. **Interim Coverage**
   - Assign accounts to existing team
   - Prevent customer churn
   - Manager coverage for key deals

3. **Accelerate Hiring**
   - Activate evergreen pipeline
   - Increase offer competitiveness
   - Expedite background checks

### Medium-Term Actions

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Exit interviews
   - Compensation benchmarking
   - Manager effectiveness reviews
   - Workload assessment

2. **Retention Initiatives**
   - Compensation adjustments
   - Career pathing programs
   - Manager training
   - Work-life balance improvements

3. **Hiring Plan Update**
   - Buffer capacity (over-hire)
   - Faster ramp programs
   - Evergreen recruiting

## Best Practices

### 1. Track in Real-Time

Update Loss Capacity immediately when:
- Employee gives notice
- Termination occurs
- LOA begins

**Don't wait for monthly close.**

### 2. Separate Permanent vs Temporary

```
Total Loss Capacity: $6.2M
  ├─ Permanent (attrition): $5.0M
  └─ Temporary (LOA): $1.2M
```

**Why:** Different responses (backfill vs wait for return)

### 3. Report Both Annual and Actual Impact

```
Tom left Oct 15:
  Annual Quota: $1.4M (Loss Capacity metric)
  Q4 Impact: ~$175K (actual revenue at risk)
```

### 4. Compare to Historical Baseline

```
Current Quarter Loss: $6.2M
Historical Avg (last 4Q): $2.0M
→ 210% above normal (CRISIS)
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Only Counting Headcount

**Mistake:** "We lost 5 people"

**Better:** "We lost $6.2M of capacity (5 people)"

**Why:** Not all people have equal capacity (quotas vary)

### 2. Not Tracking LOA Separately

**Mistake:** Treating LOA same as permanent attrition

**Reality:** LOA is temporary, employee returns, no backfill needed

### 3. Forgetting Mid-Period Departures

**Mistake:** Only counting end-of-quarter headcount

**Reality:** Someone who left Day 1 has different impact than Day 89

### 4. Not Segmenting Loss

**Mistake:** "We lost $6.2M" (no additional context)

**Better:** "We lost $6.2M: 61% from Enterprise AE, 67% from one manager's team"

**Why:** Reveals specific problems to address

## Loss Capacity in Capacity Planning

### Beginning of Quarter (BoQ) to End of Quarter (EoQ) Flow

```
BoQ Capacity: $11.0M
Less: Loss Capacity: -$6.2M
Plus: Backfills Added: +$0.9M (partial ramp)
─────────────────────────────
EoQ Capacity: $5.7M
```

### Forecasting Future Loss

Use [Capacity at Risk](/docs/metrics/capacity-at-risk) to predict next quarter's Loss Capacity:

```
Q1 2026 BoQ Capacity: $5.7M
Predicted Q1 2026 Loss (13.5% rate): $770K
```

**Plan for:** $770K of Loss Capacity in Q1, need 1-2 backfills
