# Gap to Target

## Definition

**Gap to Target** is the difference between your target capacity (what you need) and your current capacity (what you have). It quantifies whether you're overstaffed, understaffed, or right-sized.

## Formula

```
Gap to Target = Target Capacity - Current Capacity
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Positive gap:** You're SHORT on capacity (need to hire)
- **Zero gap:** You're AT target (perfect world)
- **Negative gap:** You're OVER capacity (surplus)

---

## Worked Example 1: Capacity Shortfall

**Scenario:**
- Target Capacity: $10.0M
- Current Capacity: $7.0M

```
Gap to Target = $10.0M - $7.0M = +$3.0M
```

**Status:** 🔴 **30% below target** (shortfall)

**Interpretation:**
- You need $3.0M more selling capacity
- At $1.2M per fully ramped AE → Need ~2.5 more RRE
- Accounting for ramp → Need to hire 3-4 people

---

## Worked Example 2: At Target

**Scenario:**
- Target Capacity: $10.0M
- Current Capacity: $10.1M

```
Gap to Target = $10.0M - $10.1M = -$0.1M
```

**Status:** 🟢 **At target** (within 1%)

**Interpretation:**
- Team is properly sized
- Maintain current hiring pace to offset attrition
- Focus on retention and productivity

---

## Worked Example 3: Over-Capacity

**Scenario:**
- Target Capacity: $10.0M
- Current Capacity: $12.5M

```
Gap to Target = $10.0M - $12.5M = -$2.5M
```

**Status:** 🟡 **25% over target** (surplus)

**Interpretation:**
- You have more capacity than needed
- Might be intentional (buffer for attrition)
- Or accidental (over-hired, target changed)
- Consider: Slow hiring, increase quotas, expand TAM

---

## Gap in Headcount Terms

Convert dollar gap to people equivalent:

```
Headcount Gap = Gap to Target / Standard Quota
```

**Example:**
```
Gap: $3.0M
Standard Quota: $1.2M annual
Headcount Gap: $3.0M / $1.2M = 2.5 people

→ Need to hire 3 people to close gap (rounding up)
```

**⚠️ Important:** This assumes fully ramped reps. If hiring now:
- 3 hires today → Only ~0.75 RRE capacity this quarter (due to ramp)
- Need MORE hires if trying to close gap quickly

---

## Quarterly Gap Progression

Track how gap changes over time:

| Quarter | Target | Current | Gap | Status |
|---------|--------|---------|-----|--------|
| Q1 2025 | $10M | $15.3M | -$5.3M | 🟢 Over (buffer) |
| Q2 2025 | $10M | $13.3M | -$3.3M | 🟢 Over (buffer) |
| Q3 2025 | $10M | $11.1M | -$1.1M | 🟢 Slightly over |
| Q4 2025 | $10M | $7.0M | +$3.0M | 🔴 Short (crisis) |

**Trend Analysis:**
- Started year with 53% surplus
- Each quarter, attrition eroded capacity faster than backfills could restore
- By Q4, flipped to 30% shortfall
- **Action needed:** Accelerate hiring in Q1

---

## Root Causes of Gap

### Positive Gap (Shortfall)

**Why you're short on capacity:**

1. **High Attrition**
   - Lost more people than expected
   - Didn't backfill fast enough
   - Example: 45% quarterly attrition vs 13% expected

2. **Slow Hiring**
   - Positions left open too long
   - Time-to-hire exceeded plan
   - Offers declined

3. **Ramp Drag**
   - New hires ramping slower than expected
   - Poor onboarding
   - Too many junior hires

4. **Leaves of Absence**
   - Temporary capacity loss
   - Medical, parental, sabbatical

5. **Quota Increases**
   - Target capacity raised mid-year
   - Market expansion
   - New product lines

### Negative Gap (Surplus)

**Why you're over-capacity:**

1. **Over-Hiring**
   - Hired ahead of target
   - Buffer for attrition
   - Aggressive growth plan

2. **Lower Attrition**
   - Retention improved unexpectedly
   - Market cooled down

3. **Faster Ramp**
   - Better onboarding than planned
   - Experienced hires ramped quickly

4. **Target Reduction**
   - Revenue target lowered
   - Market contraction
   - Product sunset

## Setting Target Capacity

### Top-Down Approach (Revenue-Driven)

```
Step 1: Set Revenue Target
Annual Revenue Goal: $50M

Step 2: Define Standard Quota
Average Quota per Rep: $1M

Step 3: Account for Attainment
Expected Team Attainment: 85%

Step 4: Calculate Capacity Needed
Target Capacity = $50M / 85% = $58.8M

Step 5: Convert to RRE
Target RRE = $58.8M / $1M = 58.8 RRE
```

### Bottom-Up Approach (Coverage-Driven)

```
Step 1: Define Coverage Need
Total Addressable Accounts: 5,000
Accounts per Rep: 100

Step 2: Calculate Reps Needed
Required Reps = 5,000 / 100 = 50 reps

Step 3: Account for Ramp
If 20% of team is ramping at 60% avg:
  40 fully ramped = 40 RRE
  10 ramping at 60% = 6 RRE
  Target: 46 RRE effective

Step 4: Convert to Dollars
At $1M per RRE:
Target Capacity = 46 RRE × $1M = $46M
```

## Managing the Gap

### Closing a Positive Gap (Shortfall)

**3 strategies:**

#### 1. Hire More

```
Current Capacity: $7.0M
Gap: +$3.0M
→ Hire 3-4 reps
→ Timeline: 6 months to full productivity
```

**Pros:** Permanent solution
**Cons:** Expensive, slow to ramp

#### 2. Accelerate Ramp

```
Current ramp: 5 months to 100%
Improved ramp: 4 months to 100%
→ Existing 3 ramping reps gain +$0.9M capacity one month earlier
```

**Pros:** Faster impact
**Cons:** Requires onboarding investment

#### 3. Reduce Attrition

```
Current attrition: 15% quarterly
Improved attrition: 10% quarterly
→ Save 5% × $7.0M = $350K per quarter
```

**Pros:** Protects existing capacity
**Cons:** Long-term cultural fixes

---

### Managing a Negative Gap (Surplus)

**3 strategies:**

#### 1. Slow Hiring

```
Current plan: Hire 4 reps per quarter
Adjusted plan: Hire 2 reps per quarter
→ Let natural attrition reduce surplus
```

**Pros:** No layoffs, cost-efficient
**Cons:** Takes time

#### 2. Increase Quotas

```
Current quota: $1M per rep
New quota: $1.2M per rep
→ Same headcount, higher target capacity
```

**Pros:** Leverages existing team
**Cons:** Risk of demotivation if too aggressive

#### 3. Expand TAM

```
Surplus capacity: $2.5M
→ Enter new market segment
→ Launch new product
→ Geographic expansion
```

**Pros:** Growth opportunity
**Cons:** Requires market validation

## Acceptable Gap Thresholds

### Recommended Tolerances

| Gap Range | Status | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **-10% to +10%** | 🟢 Green | No action, maintain course |
| **+10% to +20%** | 🟡 Yellow | Accelerate hiring, monitor closely |
| **+20% to +30%** | 🟠 Orange | Urgent hiring needed |
| **> +30%** | 🔴 Red | Crisis mode, re-evaluate targets |
| **< -10%** | 🟡 Yellow | Slow hiring, consider reallocation |

### Example Status Report

**Current Quarter:**
```
Target: $10.0M
Current: $7.0M
Gap: +$3.0M (30%)
Status: 🔴 Red (Crisis)
Action: Hire 4 AEs immediately, expected recovery by Q3
```

---

## Forecasting Future Gap

Project gap trajectory based on hiring plan:

**Example:**

| Quarter | Target | Current | Gap | Action Plan |
|---------|--------|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Q4 2025** | $10M | $7.0M | +$3.0M | 🔴 Crisis |
| **Q1 2026** | $10M | $7.3M | +$2.7M | 🟠 Hire 4 AEs |
| **Q2 2026** | $10M | $8.5M | +$1.5M | 🟡 Ramp continuing |
| **Q3 2026** | $10M | $9.8M | +$0.2M | 🟢 Nearly closed |
| **Q4 2026** | $10M | $10.5M | -$0.5M | 🟢 At target |

**Recovery timeline: 4 quarters from crisis to target**

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Report Gap as %

```
❌ Gap: $3.0M (What does this mean?)
✅ Gap: $3.0M (30% below target)
```

### 2. Show Trend

```
Q3 Gap: -$1.1M (11% over)
Q4 Gap: +$3.0M (30% under)
→ Swing of $4.1M in one quarter (attrition spike)
```

### 3. Break Down by Team

| Team | Target | Current | Gap | Status |
|------|--------|---------|-----|--------|
| Northeast | $4M | $2.8M | +$1.2M | 🔴 Short |
| Southeast | $3M | $2.9M | +$0.1M | 🟢 Good |
| West | $3M | $3.5M | -$0.5M | 🟢 Over |

**Insight:** Northeast has critical gap, West has surplus → Transfer resources?

### 4. Communicate Action Plan

```
Gap: $3.0M (30% below target)

Recovery Plan:
• Hire 4 AEs in Q1 (approved)
• Expected start dates: 2 in Month 1, 2 in Month 3
• Full recovery: Q4 2026 (assuming 13% attrition)
• Risk: If attrition exceeds 15%, need 1-2 additional hires
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Comparing to Wrong Target

**Mistake:** Using annual target for quarterly gap

**Example:**
```
Annual Target: $40M
Current Capacity (Q1): $8M
Gap: +$32M ← WRONG!
```

**Correct:**
```
Quarterly Target: $10M
Current Capacity: $8M
Gap: +$2M
```

### 2. Not Accounting for Ramp in Solutions

**Mistake:** "Gap is $3M, hire 3 people, gap closed."

**Reality:** Those 3 people contribute ~$0.75M in first quarter. Gap won't close for 4-5 quarters.

### 3. Treating All Gaps Equally

**Mistake:** +10% gap treated same as +30% gap

**Reality:** +10% is normal fluctuation, +30% is crisis requiring immediate action.
